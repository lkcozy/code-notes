## Tip

When you’re aware of the biases you hold as a leader, you’ll be better positioned to correct (or avoid perpetuating) discriminatory behavior on your team.

Start by `slowing down and questioning your assumptions`. Here are a few questions you can reflect on: How would my team describe my leadership style if they were sharing their experience of working with me to others? Do my words and actions actually reflect my intentions? What core beliefs do I hold? How might these beliefs limit or enable me and my colleagues at work? Look for patterns of thinking in your answers.

It’s also important to `seek out feedback from your colleagues to understand how they perceive you and what you can do better`. People whose perspectives and opinions differ from yours are more likely to provide you with insightful feedback. You could say, “I value your opinion and am curious about the impact of my leadership style. Would you be willing to have a conversation about this? Is there something I can improve upon that will have a positive impact on the team?”

Taking these steps will `help you be a leader who’s self-aware, learning, and constantly challenging their biases`.

当你意识到你作为领导者所持有的偏见时，你就能更好地纠正（或避免长期存在）团队中的歧视行为。

首先放慢速度，质疑你的假设。这里有几个你可以思考的问题：如果我的团队和其他人分享他们与我一起工作的经验，他们会如何描述我的领导风格？ 我的言行是否反映了我的意图？ 我的核心信念是什么？ 这些信念如何限制或使我和我的同事在工作中？ 在你的答案中寻找思维模式。

同样重要的是，从你的同事那里寻求反馈，了解他们如何看待你，以及你可以在哪些方面做得更好。 观点和意见与你不同的人更有可能给你提供有洞察力的反馈。 你可以说：“我重视你的意见，并对我的领导风格的影响感到好奇。 你愿意和我谈谈这件事吗？ 有没有什么我可以改进的地方，对球队有积极的影响？

采取这些步骤将帮助你成为一个有自我意识的领导者，学习并不断挑战自己的偏见。
