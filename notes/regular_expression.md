A regular expression, or regex for short, is a pattern describing a certain amount of text.

A valid regex consists of `alphanumeric characters` representing the set of input symbols (e.g. a, B, 9), the `$` character representing the empty string, the choice operator `+`, the Kleene operator `s`, and parentheses `(` and `)`. An example of a valid regex is: `(a+B)_(c9+$)+$`.

## Cheat Sheet

- `*` Quantifier — Matches between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed (greedy)
- `.*` matches any character (except for line terminators)
- `\dt` means one or more numbers

- `(\d{3})(\d{4})(\d{4})`
  - 1st Capturing Group (`\d{3}`)
    - `\d{3}` matches a digit (equal to [0-9])
    - `{3}` Quantifier — Matches exactly 3 times

- replace different strings with the same string
  `/color: (rgb\(255, 255, 255\)|#f{6}}|#fff|white)/g, 'color: #000')`

  - `gi`: means global, case-insensitive,

- Multipliers

  - `* -` item occurs zero or more times.
  - `+ -` item occurs one or more times.
  - `? -` item occurs zero or one times.
  - {5} - item occurs five times.
  - {3,7} - item occurs between 3 and 7 times.
  - {2,} - item occurs at least 2 times.

- `l.*?k`: Are you looking at the lock or the silk?

## Basic

### [Literal Characters](https://www.regular-expressions.info/characters.html)

Twelve characters have special meanings in regular expressions: the **backslash** `\`, the **caret** `^`, the **dollar sign** `$`, the **period** or **dot** `.`, the **vertical bar** or **pipe symbol** `|`, the question mark `?`, the **asterisk or star** `*`, the **plus sign** `+`, the **opening parenthesis** `(`, the **closing parenthesis** `)`, the **opening square bracket** `[`, and the **opening curly brace** `{`. These special characters are often called “metacharacters”. Most of them are errors when used alone.

### [Character Classes or Character Sets](https://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html)

To match an a or an e, use [ae]. You could use this in gr[ae]y to match either gray or grey.

A character class matches only a single character. gr[ae]y does not match graay, graey or any such thing.
