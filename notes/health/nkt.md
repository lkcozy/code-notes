Natural Killer (NK) cells are specialized `lymphocytes` that play critical roles in the immune response against abnormal cells, including all kinds of cancer cells.

> Lymphocytes: a type of white blood cell involved in fighting disease and infection in the body, some of which produce antibodies (= proteins that attack and kill harmful bacteria)
