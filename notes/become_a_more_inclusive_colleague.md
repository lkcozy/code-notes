## Tip

It’s not just leaders who impact the culture on a team. Peers have the power to include or exclude other individuals, and research has shown that the exercise of that power can make a meaningful difference to work performance. In other words, we all help define what it means to work in an inclusive workplace. Here are three small ways you can make a difference on your team.

- Offer a helping hand. Look for opportunities to provide your colleagues with key information or training, make introductions to new contacts (especially mentors), and give endorsements in meetings.
- Demonstrate care about non-work issues. Show personal interest in your coworkers' family lives, hobbies, pets — whatever matters to them outside of the workplace. And if an opportunity arises to provide support, be ready to offer it.
- Create in-person connections when possible. If you have a chance to walk to a meeting with your colleague, or to go grab an in-person meal or coffee, take it.

   <summary>🇨🇳 做一个更包容的同事</summary>

影响团队文化的不仅仅是领导者。同伴拥有包容或排斥他人的权力，研究表明，这种权力的行使可以对工作表现产生有意义的影响。换句话说，我们都在帮助定义在一个包容的工作场所工作的意义。这里有三个小方法可以让你的团队有所不同。

- 伸出援助之手。 寻找机会向你的同事提供关键信息或培训，介绍新的联系人（特别是导师），并在会议上给予支持。
- 表现出对非工作问题的关心。 对同事的家庭生活、爱好、宠物表现出你个人的兴趣——不管工作场所之外对他们有多重要。 如果有机会提供支持，就要准备好提供支持。
- 尽可能建立面对面的联系。 如果你有机会和同事一起步行去开会，或者去吃顿饭或喝杯咖啡，那就抓住它。
