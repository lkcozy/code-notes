## [AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript)

A suite of utilities for AWS Lambda Functions that makes structured logging, creating custom metrics asynchronously and tracing with AWS X-Ray easier

> Lambda Layer is a .zip file archive that can contain additional code, pre-packaged dependencies, data, or configuration files. Layers promote code sharing and separation of responsibilities so that you can iterate faster on writing business logic.

### Commands

Get associated aws account id

```zsh
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile legacy --output json | jq ".Account" | sed 's/\"//g'
```

  - `CloudFormation`: Templates to create and configure AWS components (think terraform/sls)
- Machine Learning
  - `Amazon SageMaker`: Machine learning tools
- Analytics
  - `Athena`: Query data stored in s3 buckets.
  - `AWS Glue`: ETL service. Enrich, validate data.
- Mobile
  - `AWS Amplify`: Let AWS automatically generate frontend & backend apps and deploy them automatically.
  - `AWS AppSync`: Create API backends that you can connect to. Can be created through AWS Amplify as well.
- Application Integration
  - `Application Integration`: State machines written in amazon‚Äôs own language
  - `Simple Notification Service`: Notification system that can notify through email, api endpoints, sms etc.
  - `Simple Queue Service`: Message queue system
- Customer Engagement
  - `Simple Email Service`: Send out emails. Email provider.
- Internet Of Things
  - `IoT Core`: Manage fleets of IOT devices through MQTT broker
  - `FreeRTOS`: RTOS operating system for microcontrollers to automatically connect to IOT-Core or greengrass.
  - `IoT 1-Click`: Manage 1-click buttons that can be connected to other systems - like Lambda
  - `IoT Analytics`: Clean up and save messages from topics into a data-store for analytics
  - `IoT Device Defender`: Detect unwanted issues on your devices and take actions
  - `IoT Device Management`: Organize IoT devices into groups, schedule jobs on the devices and configure remote access
  - `IoT Events`: Monitor telemetry from devices and then trigger other AWS services or jobs on the devices themselves
  - `IoT Greengrass`: A message broker can buffer messages for groups of up to 200 devices which can communicate and process data locally if connectivity to IoT Core is intermittent.
  - `IoT SiteWise`: Collect, organize, analyze and visualize data from industrial equipment at scale
  - `IoT Things Graph`: Cloudformation-like designer for graphing how devices should communicate with other AWS services
- Containers
  - `Elastic Container Registry`: Store docker images like on DockerHub
