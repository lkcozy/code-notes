Amazon MQ is a managed `message broker service` for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud. 

You get direct access to the ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ consoles and industry standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP 1.0 and 0.9.1, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket.

- Q: When would I use Amazon MQ vs. managing ActiveMQ, or RabbitMQ, on Amazon EC2 myself?

The choice depends on how closely you want to manage your message broker and underlying infrastructure. Amazon MQ provides a managed message broker service that takes care of operating your message broker, including set up, monitoring, maintenance, and provisioning the underlying infrastructure for high availability and durability.
