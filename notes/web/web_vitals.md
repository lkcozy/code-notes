- `Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)` measures a page’s loading. The goal here should be a LCP within 2.5 seconds once the page starts loading.

- `First Input Delay (FID)` measures a page’s interactivity. A solid user experience here means there’s a FID of less than 100 milliseconds.

- `Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)` measures a page’s visual stability. For a good user experience, CLS should be less than 0.1 seconds..
