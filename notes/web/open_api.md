The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines `a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs` which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

- `The main advantage` of using a standard definition is that the third-party users can interact with and understand the service with minimal implementation logic, as long as they are familiar with RESTful APIs basics.

- API specifications are either written in `YAML` or `JSON`, formats that are readable, and easy to learn for both machines and humans.
