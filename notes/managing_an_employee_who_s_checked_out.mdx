## Tip

There are many reasons an employee might mentally check out. They could be experiencing burnout or a personal issue, or they could be totally unaware that they’ve been slipping.

Before you initiate a conversation, learn about any available support systems — including employee resource groups, assistance plans, and health networks — that could help your employee if they need it.

Next ask yourself: What are the specific requirements of the job that this person is not meeting? Be ready to present this evidence.

Then, open an honest and empathetic dialogue. Give your employee a chance to tell you what’s going on before sharing your assessment of their performance. Be compassionate and make it clear you have a sincere desire to support them.

Then discuss your priorities, be straightforward and specific about your concerns, and come up with a plan to re-engage them in their work. You need to be patient — but to a point.

Lighting a spark under a disengaged employee won’t happen overnight. But if an employee is truly checked out, it ultimately might not be the right role for them.

   <summary>🇨🇳 管理一名不尽职的员工</summary>

员工可能会因为很多原因而精神失常。他们可能正在经历倦怠或个人问题，或者他们可能完全没有意识到自己在走下坡路。

在开始对话之前，要先了解任何可用的支持系统，包括员工资源组、援助计划和健康网络等，如果你的员工需要的话，它们可以帮助他们。

然后再来问自己:这个人没有达到这份工作的哪些具体要求? 准备好拿出证据。

接着，展开一场诚实而富有同理心的对话。给你的员工一个机会告诉你发生了什么，然后再分享你对他们表现的评估。要有同情心，表示你真心想支持他们。

然后讨论你的优先事项，直接而具体地表达你的担忧，并提出一个让他们重新投入工作的计划。你需要有耐心，但也要有限度。

一夜之间不可能在不尽职的员工身上点燃火花。但是，如果员工真的完全脱离了，那么这个职位最终可能并不适合他们。
