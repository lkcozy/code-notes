## Tip

So your boss offers you a promotion, and it’s nothing more than an empty new title — no new responsibilities, no raise, and no increased resources. What should you do?

Start `figuring out who else has been recently promoted to the same title and talk to them to get more info about what they were offered`. If they’re not comfortable sharing what they’re making, ask them what else is in their compensation package. 

If you sense that something's not quite right — that you're not being properly compensated, or that your responsibilities don't reflect your new title — have an open conversation with your manager about your concerns.If they meant for the new title to be a reward, they might realize that their intent didn’t match their impact. They might also then decide to compensate you based on the new title.

And if that conversation doesn't lead to a satisfying resolution, `connect with your HR representative and present them with the facts and details you’ve been able to gather`. It’s their job to ensure that all team members are being leveled appropriately and paid fairly and competitively.

Finally, if you’ve determined that you can’t find allies in your organization to help get you what you deserve, it may be time to reject the offer and look for a new gig.

你的老板给你升职了，但这只不过是一个空洞的新头衔——没有新的职责，没有加薪，也没有增加资源。你应该怎么做?

开始找出最近还有谁被提升到同样的职位，和他们交谈，了解他们被提供的更多信息。如果他们不愿意和别人分享自己的收入，那就问问他们还有什么其他的收入。

如果你感觉有些事情不太对，比如你没有得到适当的补偿，或者你的职责不能反映你的新职位，那么就和你的经理开诚布公地谈谈你的担忧。如果他们打算将新头衔作为一种奖励，他们可能会意识到自己的意图与自己的影响力并不匹配。然后他们可能会决定根据新头衔给你补偿。

如果谈话没有带来一个令人满意的解决方案，联系你的人力资源代表，向他们展示你所收集到的事实和细节。他们的工作是确保所有的团队成员都得到适当的平衡，公平的薪酬和有竞争力的薪酬。

最后，如果你决定在公司里找不到盟友来帮你得到你应得的，那么可能是时候拒绝这份工作，去找一份新工作了。
