## Tip

Low-stakes negotiations — like asking your cable company for a better rate or asking for a discount when offering to pay cash — may not seem worth it. But these low-stakes negotiation opportunities can boost your confidence when it comes to your next high-stakes negotiations (like asking for a raise or countering a job offer). To practice negotiating more frequently, ask yourself the following questions about situations you encounter in your everyday life:

- Is this situation fair? Are others being offered better compensation, or do they benefit from fewer responsibilities, more resources, a bonus, or a better (cheaper, faster) deal?
- Do I deserve a better or fairer outcome than what I’ve been offered?
- Am I feeling uneasy or hesitant about the situation or offer? Would a more confident version of me make a request to get a better or more fair outcome?

Recognizing and evaluating potential opportunities to negotiate — weighing the financial, emotional, moral, or psychological trade-offs — will open the door to even better outcomes when the stakes are high.

   <summary>🇨🇳 每天练习谈判 </summary>

低风险的谈判——比如要求你的有线电视公司提供更好的价格，或者在提供现金支付时要求折扣——可能不值得。但这些低风险的谈判机会可以在下一次高风险谈判（如要求加薪或拒绝工作邀请）时提升你的信心。为了练习更频繁的谈判，问自己以下关于你日常生活中遇到的情况：

- 这种情况公平吗? 其他人是否得到了更好的待遇，还是他们从更少的责任、更多的资源、奖金或更好(更便宜、更快)的协议中获益?
- 我应该得到比我得到的更好或更公平的结果吗？
- 我是否对所提供的情况感到不安或犹豫?一个更自信的我是否会提出请求以得到更好或更公平的结果。

认识和评估潜在的谈判机会，权衡财务、情感、道德或心理上的权衡，当风险很高时，将为更好的结果打开大门。
