## Tip

As we climb the corporate ladder, many of us reach a point where we wonder, “Where do I go from here?” After all, there are only a handful of positions in the C-suite, re-orgs happen regularly, and technological disruptions change the nature of our jobs. But this doesn’t mean you have to retire early. As you think about building the second half of your career, keep these four concepts in mind.

First, <Highlight>cultivate an entrepreneurial spirit</Highlight>, even if you have no intention of starting a business. Think of your career itself as a startup — what problems are you eager and able to solve, who is your target audience, and what's the most effective way to provide your service to them?

Next, <Highlight>share your expertise with a sense of confidence</Highlight>. Your experience is unique, so let the world know about it!

Third, <Highlight>hold on to a growth mindset</Highlight>. You'll never be done learning and improving, so stay curious, skeptical, and be ready to fail.

And finally, <Highlight>prepare to reinvent yourself</Highlight>. The times are changing at an increasing pace. Are you ready to change with them?

现在就为你的职业生涯的下半段做计划

当我们在公司的阶梯上攀登时，我们中的许多人都会想到，“我该从这里走到哪里?” 毕竟，高层位置屈指可数， 更替经常发生，技术上的颠覆改变了我们工作的性质。但这并不意味着你必须提前退休。 当你考虑下半段职业生涯时，请记住以下四个概念。

首先，培养一种企业家精神，即使你没有创业的打算。把你自己的职业本身想象成一家创业公司,你渴望并能够解决哪些问题，谁是你的目标受众，以及向他们提供服务的最有效的方式是什么?

第二，自信地分享你的专业知识。你的经历是独一无二的，所以让全世界都知道吧!

第三 ，保持一种成长的心态。 你永远不会完成学习和进步，所以保持好奇，怀疑，并做好失败的准备。

最后，做好重塑自我的准备。 时代在以越来越开的速度变化。你准备好跟他们一起改变吗？
