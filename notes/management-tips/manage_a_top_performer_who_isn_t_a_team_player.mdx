## Tip

Having a supremely talented and confident employee is a wonderful thing — except, of course, if that person is alienating their colleagues. How can you help this dominant personality improve their relationships? For starters, you need to provide some tough feedback. Be honest about how they’re being perceived, and explain the consequences of their behavior. Say something like, “In order to live up to your talent, you need to consider how you might be standing in your own way.” Next, encourage them to develop more empathy and consider their colleagues’ perspectives and viewpoints. You might say, “What matters to this person? What is their biggest concern? How can you find common ground with them?” Your objective is to foster their social and self-awareness. But don’t expect your efforts to yield immediate results. Behavioral changes take time. Encourage your employee to be patient as well — with themselves and others.
