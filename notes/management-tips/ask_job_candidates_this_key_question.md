## Tip

As a hiring manager, there’s one key question you should ask every job candidate: How do you learn? Of course, you want to bring in employees with impressive achievements and qualifications, but a person’s future performance will largely be determined by how intentionally and systematically they develop their skills.

So spend some time digging into the question of learning during the interview process. Ask the candidate about something they’ve learned recently and how they could apply it to the role for which you’re considering them. Be open-minded about what counts as learning. They might have taken a lesson or developed a new perspective from online courses, books, people, poems, songs, films, conversations, observations, reflections, memories, and more. So inquire about what kind of content the candidate tends to rely on to acquire new skills and insights. To emphasize the importance of learning on your team, you should also be prepared to answer the question yourself.

   <summary>🇨🇳 问求职者这个关键问题</summary>

对于招聘经理来说，最重要的是你要问每一个求职者一个问题:你如何学习? 当然，你希望引进的员工有令人印象深刻的成就和资历。但是，一个人未来的表现在很大程度上将取决于他们如何有意识、有系统地发展自己的技能。

因此，在面试中花些时间去深入了解应聘者的学习问题。问问求职者他们最近学到的东西，以及他们如何将这些知识运用到你考虑的职位上。以开放的心态看待学习。他们可以从在线课程、书籍、人物、诗歌、歌曲、电影、谈话、观察、反思、记忆等方面吸取了教训或发展了新的视角。因此，询问应聘者倾向于依靠什么样的内容来获得新的技能和洞察力。要强调团队学习的重要性，你也要做好自己回答这个问题的准备。
