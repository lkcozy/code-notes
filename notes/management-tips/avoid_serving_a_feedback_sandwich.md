## Tip

As a manager, you’ve likely delivered a “feedback sandwich”: two pieces of positive reinforcement wrapped around a thick slice of criticism. While this approach may feel like you’re softening the blow, it rarely achieves the goal of helping someone improve.

- Instead, **start by describing the behavior you want to correct**. For example, rather than saying, "You were really rude in that meeting," you could say something like, “I noticed you interrupted the client twice in that meeting.”

- **Then explain the impact of the behavior so the employee knows what’s at stake**. Avoid self-serving statements like “You really made me look bad in there,” and focus instead on them: “You missed an opportunity to learn more about your client.”

- **Finally lay out what you would like them to do instead**. Be specific: “Next time, if a thought comes up while the client is speaking, jot it down and wait until they finish before jumping in.”

This kind of feedback is respectful, clear, and actionable, and will boost your chances of actually pushing your employee to learn and grow.

   <summary>🇨🇳 避免提供“反馈三明治”</summary>

身为管理者，你可能会提供一个“反馈三明治”。你可能提供了一个“反馈三明治”: 将严厉的批评放在两个加强的积极评价中。虽然这种方法会让你感觉你在缓和压力，但是它很少能达到帮助别人提高的目标。

相反，先描述你想纠正的行为。例如，与其说“你在会议上真是很无礼”，倒不如说“我注意到你在会议上打断了客户两次。”

然后解释这一行为的影响，让员工了解到其危害。不要说“你真的让我看起来很糟糕”这种的自私的话，而是要关注那些表达:“你错失了更多了解你的客户的机会。”

最后列出你想让他们做什么。明确地说:“下一次，如果客户在发表言论时有什么想法，把它记下来，等到他们说完再跳进去。” 这种反馈是尊重的、明确的、可行的，并能增加你真正促进员工学习和成长的机会。
