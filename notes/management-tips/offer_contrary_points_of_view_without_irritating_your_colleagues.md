## Tip

No one wants to be that contrarian — the one on the team who always has to slow things down and poke holes in the group’s thinking. People can find that person annoying, but there's huge upside to voicing a dissonant point of view.

To become a contrarian who your teammates will appreciate, `start by learning when to speak out, and when not to`. Not every idea needs to be challenged — but some certainly do. `Look for received wisdom that feels under-scrutinized or complex ideas that have been oversimplified`. These are worth asking questions about.

It helps to `bring in outside perspectives` when challenging the dominant perspective, so do your research and make well-informed suggestions based on a wide array of sources, conversations, and ideas. `Remember you’re not tearing down ideas — you’re offering alternative ways of thinking`.

Finally, `present your suggestions as experiments, not truths`. This will allow people to more easily consider your perspective without getting defensive.

没有人想在团队中成为一个总是要放慢节奏，在团队思维中寻找漏洞的逆向思维者。人们可能会觉得那个人很烦人，但说出不一致的观点有很大的好处。

要想成为你的队友会欣赏的逆向主义者，首先要学会什么时候该说，什么时候不该说。并非每个想法都需要挑战，但有些想法确实需要挑战。寻找那些感觉被忽视或过于简单化的复杂想法。这些都值得一问。

当挑战主流观点时，引入外部观点会有所帮助，你的研究也是如此，并根据广泛的来源、对话和想法提出有见地的建议。记住，你不是在否定之前的想法——你是在提供另一种思维方式。

最后，把你的建议作为实验，而不是事实。这将允许人们更容易地考虑你的观点，而不会采取防卫态度。
