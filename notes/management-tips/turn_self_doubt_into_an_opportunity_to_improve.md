## Tip

Imposter syndrome is the persistent, nagging thought that tells us that weâ€™re undeserving of our achievements. If youâ€™ve ever felt that way, youâ€™re not alone. So, how can you channel feelings of self-doubt into something more constructive and productive? Here are some tips.

- Reframe self-doubt. Instead of shying away from experiences that trigger your doubt, deliberately embrace them. Remember that challenges are opportunities to learn. Think of your nerves as a reminder that there is always room to grow.
- Be okay not being the smartest person in the room. Ironically, you appear more confident when you demonstrate the humility and courage to ask about what you donâ€™t know.
- Cherish feedback, even when itâ€™s critical. No one likes to hear what theyâ€™re doing wrong, but thatâ€™s the only way to grow. Assume good will from the feedback giver. They took the time to point out your development areas because they want to see you improve and believe that you can. After receiving the feedback, take some time to plan out how you will apply it â€” you might even do this with the person who gave it to you.
