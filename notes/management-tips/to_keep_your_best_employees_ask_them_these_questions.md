## Tip

If you’re serious about retaining the people on your team (as you should be), consider conducting “stay” interviews. These are discussions where you ask loyal employees key questions to understand how engaged they are. The information you gather can help you tackle common retention issues. Here are four questions to try:

-`What’s your frame of mind today? No matter what the response is` — positive or negative — don’t negate their experience or move too quickly to solving a problem. Just listen, thank them for being honest, and ask for more information before moving toward a solution.

- `Who do you feel connected to at work`? Based on their response, explore what you can do to help them deepen those connections. Perhaps people from different departments can work on a company-wide event, a cross-division initiative, or take part in virtual discussion groups.
- `What do you want to learn that will excite you and help you grow`? This question signals that you care about their development and want to help them achieve their aspirations.
- `What barriers can I remove for you to help you do your job better`? Then brainstorm with your colleague how you can be most helpful. Ensuring people can do their jobs well is just as important as praise and rewards.

   <summary>🇨🇳 为了留住你最好的员工，问他们这些问题</summary>

如果你真的想要留住团队中的人(这是你应该做的)，考虑进行留任面试。在这些讨论中，你会问忠诚的员工一些关键问题，以了解他们的敬业程度。你所收集的信息可以帮助你解决常见的留存问题。下面是四个问题：

- 今天心情如何?不管他们的反应是积极的还是消极的，不要否定他们的经历，也不要急于解决问题。只需倾听，感谢他们的诚实，在寻求解决方案之前询问更多信息。
- 在工作中你觉得和谁有联系?根据他们的回答，探索你能做些什么来帮助他们加深这些联系。也许来自不同部门的人可以参加公司范围内的活动，跨部门的活动，或者参加虚拟的讨论小组。
- 你想学什么能让你兴奋并帮助你成长?这个问题表明你关心他们的发展，想要帮助他们实现他们的愿望。
- 我能消除哪些障碍，帮助你把工作做得更好?然后和你的同事一起集思广益，想想怎样才能最有帮助。确保人们能把工作做好与表扬和奖励一样重要。
