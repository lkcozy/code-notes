## Tip

As companies start returning to the office, managers are finding themselves caught in the middle between employees who want to keep working from home and senior leaders who want everyone back at their desks. How can you navigate this tension?

Start by `finding out what’s driving leaders’ concerns`. Do they doubt that people are taking work seriously? Are they worried that employees aren’t collaborating enough?

Once you know what’s behind their push to return, `find ways to address those concerns`. Show that remote work is beneficial to the company, not just to individuals. For example, you can emphasize your ability to retain skilled employees who would otherwise leave. You might point out that remote work offers the ability to draw from a wider talent pool. Consider asking your HR department if they have data on how working from home is paying off for your company.

Also, `demonstrate that your team is engaged no matter where they’re located`. For example, you might invite leaders to video meetings that include both in-person and remote workers so they can see that everyone is committed and participating regardless of where they’re calling in from.

If leadership is applying pressure for employees to come back to the office, and you believe there’s a balance that could work better for everyone, try these strategies to make your case.

   <summary>🇨🇳 向希望重返办公室的领导人提出居家工作的理由</summary>

随着企业开始重返办公室，经理们发现自己被夹在中间，一方面是希望在家工作的员工，另一方面是希望所有人都回到办公桌前工作的高层领导。你如何应对这种紧张局势?

首先要找出是什么在驱动领导者的担忧。他们怀疑人们认真对待工作吗?他们是否担心员工合作不够?

一旦你知道他们返回的原因，找到解决这些问题的方法。证明远程工作不仅对个人，对公司也有好处。例如，你可以强调你有能力留住那些原本会离开的熟练员工。你可能会指出，远程工作提供了从更广泛的人才库中汲取人才的能力。可以考虑问问你的人力资源部门，他们是否有在家工作对你的公司有多大回报的数据。

另外，无论你的团队在哪里，都要证明他们都参与其中。 例如，你可以邀请领导参加视频会议，视频会议包括面对面的和远程的工作人员，这样他们可以看到每个人都很投入，不管他们是从哪里参加会议。

如果领导给员工施加压力让他们回到办公室，而你相信有一种平衡可以更好地为每个人服务，那么试试这些策略来证明你的观点。
