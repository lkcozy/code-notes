## Tip

You see an important task that needs to be done, but it isn’t your responsibility. Should you jump in and do it? Before taking on someone else’s work, consider these three factors.

First, ask yourself: What else is going on? In a turbulent environment, straying outside your lane could cause additional chaos or confusion, even if your intentions are to be a good team player.

Next, think twice before crossing team boundaries. You probably won’t have a complete enough understanding of the other team’s situation to jump in and be effective right away.

Finally, if you do decide you need to pitch in, be prepared to over-communicate — both in face-to-face huddles and over digital channels. You don’t always need to stay in your lane — just be sure to merge both out of your lane and back in with caution and care.

   <summary>🇨🇳 什么时候你应该“少管闲事”？ </summary>
你看到一项重要任务需要完成，但这不是你的责任。 你应该跳进去做这件事吗？ 在接手别人的工作之前，考虑这三个因素。

首先，问问你自己：还发生了什么？在动荡的环境中，即使你想成为一名优秀的团队成员，做分外的事也会造成额外的混乱。

其次，在跨越团队边界之前，请三思。你可能无法完全了解其他团队的情况，无法立即投入工作并发挥作用。

最后，如果你决定你需要投入，准备好过度沟通——无论是面对面交流还是数字渠道交流。你不必总是呆在你的车道上——只是要确保在离开车道和返回车道时谨慎小心。
