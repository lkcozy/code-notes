## Tip

Uncertainty is unavoidable. As a manager, you need to be prepared to lead your team through murky waters, but doing so requires getting in the right mindset yourself. Here are six tips to help you shift your perspective:

1. `Embrace the discomfort of not knowing`. Move from a know-it-all to a learn-it-all mindset. You don’t need to have all the answers.
2. `Distinguish between "complicated" and "complex" issues`. They require different solutions.
3. `Let go of perfectionism`. Instead, aim for progress, expect mistakes, and recognize that you have the ability to continually course correct as needed.
4. Resist the urge to oversimplify and come to quick conclusions. Take a disciplined approach to understanding both the complexity of the situation and your own biases.
5. `Don’t go it alone`. Connect with your peers who have their own set of experiences and perspectives to draw from.
6. `Zoom out`. Taking a broad, systemic view of the issues at hand can reveal unexamined assumptions that would otherwise be invisible.

   <summary>🇨🇳 在不确定性中领导</summary>
不确定性是在所难免的。身为管理者，你必须做好带领团队渡过难关的准备，但这需要你自己拥有正确的心态。以下是六个能帮助你转变观点的建议:
1、接受未知事物引起的不适。从“无所不知”转为“学习一切”的心态。你不必知道所有的答案。
2、区分"困难"与"复杂"的问题'。 它们需要不同的解决方案。
3、放弃完美主义。而是要追求进步，正视错误，并认识到自己有能力在需要时不断改正。
4、抑制过度简化的冲动，不要急于下结论。采取自律的方法去理解情况的复杂性和你自己的偏见
5、不要孤军奋战。联系你的同龄人，他们有他们自己的经验和可以借鉴的观点。
6、着眼全局。深入系统地观察眼前的问题，就能发现那些未经证实的、在其情况下无法看到的假设。
