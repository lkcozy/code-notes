## Tip

Hearing “no” during a negotiation can bring up all sorts of feelings: sadness, rejection, and even anger. How can you prepare for a tough conversation so you don’t react impulsively when those emotions come up?

Start by asking yourself: What if the person says no to my request? What if they say they dislike my proposal? What if they're rude or passive-aggressive?

As you work through these “what-if” scenarios, also consider: What is my go-to response? Why do I react this way? Do your best to be nonjudgmental as you go through this thought exercise. After all, we all have reactions we’re not proud of at times.

Once you’ve identified your unconscious emotional responses, think about how to manage them. Consider: If I feel stuck in the middle of the conversation, what can I do? If I hear a “no,” what are two or three ways to react without feeling frazzled or dejected? This will give you tactics you can turn to in the heat of the moment.

Consider rehearsing the conversation with a friend to help you identify your stumbles, get real-time feedback, and hopefully, feel more at ease.

Increasing your self-awareness and having alternative approaches at the ready will help you make better choices about what to react to in the moment, what emotions to embrace, and what to let pass if you hear the dreaded "no."

   <summary>🇨🇳 在谈判中随时准备好听到“不”</summary>

在谈判中听到“不”会引起各种各样的情绪：悲伤，拒绝，甚至愤怒。你怎样才能为一次艰难的谈话做好准备，这样当那些情绪出现时你就不会冲动了？

首先问问自己：如果对方拒绝了我的请求怎么办？如果他们说不喜欢我的建议怎么办？如果他们是粗鲁的或被动的攻击性？

当你处理这些假设场景时，还要考虑:我的首选回答是什么?我为什么会有这样的反应?当你进行这个思考练习时，尽量做到不带偏见。毕竟，我们每个人都有自己不引以为豪的反应。

一旦你确定了你的潜意识情绪反应，想想如何管理它们。想想看:如果我在对话中卡住了，我该怎么办?如果我听到一个“不”，有两到三种方法可以让我不感到疲惫或沮丧吗?这将给你提供一些战术，你可以在情绪激动的时候使用。

考虑和朋友一起排练这段对话，帮助你辨别自己的错误，获得实时反馈，并希望能感觉更轻松。

提高你的自我意识，准备好不同的方法，会帮助你做出更好的选择，比如在那个时刻对什么作出反应，拥抱什么情绪，以及听到可怕的“不”时让什么情绪过去。
