## Tip

An employee who left your company wants to come back. What should you do? It may seem like a good idea to rehire them: Because the former employee is a known quantity, you may consider them to be a safer bet than a new hire. But new research shows that the decision to rehire a so-called “boomerang employee” may not be so clear cut.

On the one hand, rehires may require less onboarding and may contribute more quickly than new hires. However, they also turn over at a higher rate than other employees (and more than twice as often as people who were internally promoted). And while the job performance of a boomerang employee is fairly predictable, both internal and external hires improve more on the job over time.

So, if predictability, short-term impact, and lower training costs are your goals, a boomerang employee might be the right fit. But if you’re looking for someone who’s going to stick around, an internal promotion might be the way to go.

   <summary>🇨🇳 你应该重新雇佣前雇员吗? </summary>

有个离开你们公司的员工想要回来。你应该怎么做?重新雇佣他们似乎是个好主意:因为前雇员是众所周知的，你可能会认为他们比新雇员更安全。但新的研究表明，重新聘用所谓的“回巢族”员工的决定可能并不那么明确。

一方面，重新招聘可能需要的入职时间更少，可能比新员工贡献更快。然而，他们的流动率也比其他员工高(是内部晋升人员的两倍多)。虽然“回巢族”员工的工作表现是相当可预测的，但随着时间的推移，内聘和外聘员工的工作表现都会得到更多改善。

所以，如果你的目标是可预测性、短期影响和较低的培训成本，那么回巢型员工可能是合适的人选。但如果你想找一个愿意留下来的人，内部升职可能是一个好办法。
