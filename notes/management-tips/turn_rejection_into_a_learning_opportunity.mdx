## Tip

Whether you’re applying for a new job, vying for a promotion, or pitching a big idea to your boss, when you put yourself out there and it doesn’t work out, you’re likely to feel rejected. It’s natural to feel a sting after a setback, but internalizing that negative feeling won’t help. Here are a few strategies to help you channel your inner grit and seize an opportunity to grow.

- First, <Highlight>don't allow your anticipation of any outcome to become an expectation</Highlight>. This can fuel false confidence and obscure your objectivity about how things are actually going.
- Second, <Highlight>let yourself feel the pain of rejection</Highlight>. Many people either try to bury or overindulge that feeling — neither of which is productive. Instead, name your disappointment, acknowledging that you feel hurt by the outcome. You might even talk to a trusted friend or colleague about it.
- Finally, <Highlight>use the experience to learn</Highlight>. Consider what part you played in the decision not going your way, and solicit feedback about what you could have done better. People are often willing to be honest when they think your request to improve is sincere. And ideally, you can use that input the next time you take on a similar challenge.

- 首先, 不要让你对任何结果的期待变成了期望. 这会助长你错误的自信,也会让你对事情的真实情况了解不够客观.
- 其次, 让自己感受挫折的痛苦. 很多人不是试图忽略这种感觉,就是过分纵容这种感觉--无论哪一种都不管用. 相反地, 说出你的失望, 承认自己收到了伤害. 你甚至可以向你信任的朋友或同事倾诉这件事.
- 最后, 总结经验教训. 想想你在决定不走自己的路时扮演了什么角色. 然后寻求有关你可以做得更好的方面的反馈.当人们觉得你是真心诚意地想提高进自己时, 他们通常也会坦诚相对. 在理想的情况下, 下一次遇到类似问题的时候,你可以使用这些建议.
