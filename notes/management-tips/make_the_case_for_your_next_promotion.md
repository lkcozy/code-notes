## Tip

During the pandemic, promotions have been hard to come by at many organizations. But, as some companies lift hiring and salary freezes, there’s a better chance you can make the case that you deserve a career boost. Here’s how to do that, especially when you’re still working remotely.

1. `Stay connected`. New research found that employees who put in the groundwork to build solid relationships with their managers while remote were 82% more likely to get promoted than those who hadn’t stayed in touch. So be sure to stay on your boss’s radar. Make your work visible, share ideas you’re interested in, and offer to help.
2. `Contribute`. Think about how you can use your skillset to make yourself the perfect person to lead a project. Are you great with analyzing tons of data? Can you spot and find trends and patterns others struggle with? Show your manager and team how you can be of assistance.
3. `Keep a record of your work`. Document each project in no more than 200 words. Include your role, what you learned, and any feedback you received. You can refer to this list when updating your boss or when you’re making a case for your promotion.

2. 贡献。想一想你如何运用你的技能使自己成为领导一个项目的完美人选。你擅长分析大量的数据吗？你能发现和发现别人努力奋斗的趋势和模式吗？向你的经理和团队展示你能如何提供帮助。
3. 做好工作记录。用不超过 200 字的文字记录每个项目。包括你的角色，你学到了什么，以及你收到的任何反馈。你可以在更新你的上司或者为你的晋升做准备时参考这个列表。
