Whether youâ€™re applying for a new job, vying for a promotion, or pitching a big idea to your boss, when you put yourself out there and it doesnâ€™t work out, youâ€™re likely to feel rejected. Itâ€™s natural to feel a sting after a setback, but internalizing that negative feeling wonâ€™t help. Here are a few strategies to help you channel your inner grit and seize an opportunity to grow. First, don't allow your anticipation of any outcome to become an expectation. This can fuel false confidence and obscure your objectivity about how things are actually going. Second, let yourself feel the pain of rejection. Many people either try to bury or overindulge that feeling â€” neither of which is productive. Instead, name your disappointment, acknowledging that you feel hurt by the outcome. You might even talk to a trusted friend or colleague about it. Finally, use the experience to learn. Consider what part you played in the decision not going your way, and solicit feedback about what you could have done better. People are often willing to be honest when they think your request to improve is sincere. And ideally, you can use that input the next time you take on a similar challenge.
