## Tip

1. Wellness: Are you safe and well? There's no need to disclose any personal or private information to me, but I'm here to listen and help where I can. I particularly want to know if there are areas where your work is impacting your well-being: Do you feel physically and psychologically safe, and is your work and life being balanced in a way that is compatible with your mental health.

2. Readiness : From the starting line, are you set up to succeed? Do you have everything you need to meet the expectations set for you, starting with a clear understanding of what those expectations are? How about supplies, materials, resources, partners, training, or any other precursors that could enhance your ability to be successful?

3. Obstacles : Looking ahead, what is standing in your way? One of my primary roles as your manager is to help identify and clear obstacles to your progress. Let me know what you need from me to help me help you.

4. Recognition : Since we last met, what did you accomplish that you feel good about? There is a tendency to ignore this question until performance review time, when we look back over a year and try to gather up the 1,000 tiny victories that are for most people the key indicator of progress. Let's mark down every win as we go.

5. Feedback : Again, in a healthy relationship this is happening continuously but too often will wait until an annual review. Do not make the mistake of thinking your team or manager knows what you are thinking. Make space for quick informal bits of feedback ("You were awesome in that meeting.") helps ensure that it's not ignored.

Not on this list: Progress reports. I see little value in sharing progress reports in a 1:1 except as related to the above topics. This can be done asynchronously, and/or read out in a team meeting so the information can be socialized.
