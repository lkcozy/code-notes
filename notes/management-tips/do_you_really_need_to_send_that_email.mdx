## Tip

As a business tool, email is both essential and incredibly annoying. Many of us aren’t using it in the right way and are guilty of sending way more emails than we need to. So when should you actually send an email and when should you look for another way to communicate? Email is most effective when used in these four ways:

- To formally communicate a decision
- To confirm or schedule meetings or appointments
- To document or recap important conversations
- To send company or team-wide announcements

In other words, email is a great way to give someone all the information they need in one place, especially if that information is going to be shared among a group of people. If this isn’t your goal, think about what might be the more effective way to communicate. Is it a Slack message, a call, or maybe even a meeting?

电子邮件作为一种商业工具，既是必要的，又令人讨厌。很多人不能正确使用它，并且因为发送的邮件超过了我们的需要而感到愧疚。因此，你应该在何时发送一封电子邮件，何时寻求其他的交流方式？最有效的电子邮件使用方法有四种：

- 正式通报一项决定
- 确认或安排会议或约会
- 记录或重述重要对话
- 向公司或整个团队发送公告

换言之，电子邮件是一种很好的方式，可以在一个地方提供所需的所有信息，特别是当这些信息将在一群人中被共享。 如果这不是你的目标，那就想想什么是更有效的沟通方式。它可以是一个 Slack 消息，一个电话，甚至可能是一次会议?
