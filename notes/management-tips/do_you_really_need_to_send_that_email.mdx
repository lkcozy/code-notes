## Tip

As a business tool, email is both essential and incredibly annoying. Many of us arenâ€™t using it in the right way and are guilty of sending way more emails than we need to. So when should you actually send an email and when should you look for another way to communicate? Email is most effective when used in these four ways:
To formally communicate a decision
To confirm or schedule meetings or appointments
To document or recap important conversations
To send company or team-wide announcements
In other words, email is a great way to give someone all the information they need in one place, especially if that information is going to be shared among a group of people. If this isnâ€™t your goal, think about what might be the more effective way to communicate. Is it a Slack message, a call, or maybe even a meeting?
