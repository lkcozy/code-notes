When giving feedback, you might assume your role is to tell your employee what you see, but it’s far more effective if you engage in a two-way conversation.

<Highlight>Start by asking questions about their strengths.</Highlight>
For example, you might say, <sBox>
  “Tell me about a time this month that you felt energized,”
</sBox>
or, <Box>
  “What have you learned about yourself from working on this project?”
</Box>

Asking employees to look back on these moments helps you better understand what it took to get there — and what it will take to get there again.

<Highlight>
  When employees hint at a challenge, try to draw out their concern.
</Highlight>
You might ask questions like: <Box>
  “What outcome are you trying to achieve? What have you tried so far to get
  there? How have you handled similar challenges in the past?”
</Box>
Then, help them shape the path forward. Let the employee offer ideas about next steps,
but steer the conversation and offer concrete feedback. Close with questions like,
<Box>
  “How do you think you’ll act on this?” and “What would happen if you tried
  this?”
</Box>
The best feedback helps your employees understand and build upon their strengths
— and perhaps even see themselves in a new way.

当你在为员工提供反馈时，你可能会认为自己的角色是告诉员工你看到了什么，但是如果你可以进行一场双向对话，这会更有效果。

从询问他们的长处开始。例如，你可以这么问，“告诉我，你在这个月的什么时候状态最好?”，或者“你从这个项目中学到了什么?”让员工回顾这些时刻，有助你更好地理解实现目标所需的条件，以及再次实现目标所目标所需的付出 。

当员工暗示有挑战时，试着引出他们的担忧。你可以这么问："你的目标是什么？ 到目前为止，你做了哪些努力来实现这个目标？你过去是如何应对类似挑战的？"。 然后，帮助他们规划前进的道路。让员工提供下一步的想法，但要引导对话并提供具体的反馈. 以类似“你觉得你会怎么做?”和“如果你这么做会怎么样?”这样的问题结束.

最好的反馈可以帮助你的员工理解并自己的长处,并在此基础上发展自己的长处，甚至可以用一种新的方式看待自己。
