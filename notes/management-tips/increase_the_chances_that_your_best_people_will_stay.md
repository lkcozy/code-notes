## Tip

Managers are worried about losing their best employees right now — and they probably should be. The marketplace for talent has shifted. You need to think of your employees like customers and put thoughtful attention into retaining them. Here are four steps to try:

- `Be aware of your impact`. Pause and consider how you’re showing up as a leader — in both your words and actions. It’s likely that your people are worried and stressed. Are you unintentionally adding to their fears and anxieties? Noting your impact will allow you to steer it in the right direction.
- `Give your employees respect and attention`. Identify any growth opportunities you can offer. Recognize the positive impact people are having and ask them about their aspirations. Then create a plan to help them achieve their goals.
- `Focus on potential and possibility`. Ask your team: What do you envision as the best possible outcome in the next year? What excites you about the future? How can we get there as a team?
- `Make it okay to leave`. When someone resigns, respond with gratitude for the time they’ve spent at your company. Far too often, when an employee gives notice, the reaction is akin to an emotional breakup — you’ve been left and you feel rejected. There’s a penchant to dismiss their presence and devalue their contribution. Think deeply about what this type of behavior signals to the departing employee. And remember, those that remain are watching.

   <summary>🇨🇳 增加你最好的人留下来的机会</summary>

经理们现在很担心失去他们最好的员工，他们也许应该担心。人才市场已经发生了变化。你需要把你的员工当成顾客，并花心思留住他们。这里有四个步骤可以尝试:

- 注意你的影响。停下来想一想，你在言行上都表现出了怎样的领导风范。你的员工可能会感到担忧和压力。你是否无意中增加了他们的恐惧和焦虑？注意你的影响会让你把它引向正确的方向。
- 尊重和关注你的员工。找出你能提供的任何发展机会。认识到人们正在产生的积极影响，并询问他们的愿望。然后制定一个计划来帮助他们实现目标。
- 注重潜力和可能性。 问问你的团队：你认为下一年最好的结果是什么？ 是什么让你对未来感到兴奋？ 我们怎样才能团结一致？
- 可以离开。 当有人辞职时，对他们在公司所花的时间表示感谢。 太多时候，当员工发出通知时，他们的反应就像是情感分手——你被抛弃了，感觉被拒绝了。 有一种倾向，就是不理会他们的存在，贬低他们的贡献。 深入思考这种行为对即将离职的员工意味着什么。 记住，那些留下来的人在看着。
