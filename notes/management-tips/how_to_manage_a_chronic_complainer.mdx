## Tip

Chronic complainers can have a damaging effect on those around them. So what should you do if you manage an employee who’s prone to perpetual pessimism?

First, `be realistic with yourself about the situation.` If the person is truly a chronic complainer, offering sympathy or solutions is unlikely to change their behavior or mindset. You need to set clear boundaries instead. Tell your employee that you're prepared to listen and discuss whatever is bothering them, but that your conversation needs to focus on a specific issue that can be resolved.

`Going over the same, unsolvable problem repeatedly won't do either of you any good`. If the issue at hand doesn't have a solution, or is entirely out of your hands as a manager, urge your employee to change their perspective and reframe their thinking around appreciation and gratitude for the things that they value.

Of course, `fostering this kind of a behavioral change takes time and may require support from a coach or therapist`. Present these options to your employee, and explain that while you care about their wellbeing and happiness, you may not always be the best person to help them work through all of their personal struggles.

   <summary>🇨🇳 如何管理一个长期抱怨的人 </summary>

长期的抱怨会对他们周围的人产生破坏性的影响。 那么，如果你管理的是一个长期悲观的员工，你该怎么办呢？

首先，对情况要现实一点。 如果这个人真的是一个长期抱怨者，提供同情或解决方案不太可能改变他们的行为或心态。 你需要设置清晰的边界。 告诉你的员工，你准备倾听并讨论任何困扰他们的问题，但你的谈话需要集中在一个可以解决的具体问题上。

反复讨论同样的、无法解决的问题对你们俩都没有任何好处。 如果手头上的问题没有解决办法，或者完全不在你作为经理的掌控之中，那么敦促员工改变他们的观点，重新思考他们所珍视的东西，并对它们心存感激。

当然，培养这种行为的改变需要时间，而且可能需要教练或治疗师的支持。 向你的员工提出这些选择，并解释说，虽然你关心他们的幸福和快乐，但你未必总是帮助他们度过所有的个人困难的最佳人选。
