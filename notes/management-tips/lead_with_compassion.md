## Tip

Some people might think that they have to make a difficult, binary choice between being a good person or a tough, effective leader. This is a false dichotomy. Humane leadership is not only necessary in today's world — it will actually help you develop the wisdom you need to succeed in business. Here are four ways to infuse compassion into your leadership:

- Remember the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you want to be treated. While this may sound like a cliché, it's the root of compassionate leadership.
- Listen intently. If you can hear your employees with an open mind and a willingness to learn, not only will you become wiser, you'll also become better equipped to help them.
- Be prepared to serve. Whenever you’re about to engage with someone on your team, take a moment to reflect on what might be going on with them. Then ask yourself: What support might they need? Be prepared to offer help.
- Stretch people to see their potential. When someone’s already doing well, you might fear that pushing them to do more could be discouraging or demotivating. Instead of shying away from these uncomfortable conversations, reframe them as an indication of true care. Challenging people to grow is ultimately an act of kindness.

   <summary>🇨🇳 以同情心领导 </summary>

有些人可能认为，他们必须在做一个好人或一个强硬、有效的领导者之间做出艰难的、二元的选择。 这是一个错误的二分法。 人性化的领导不仅在当今世界是必要的——它实际上将帮助你发展你在商业上成功所需要的智慧。 以下四种方法可以让你的领导充满同情

- 牢记金科玉律：以你想要被对待的方式对待别人。 虽然这听起来像是陈词滥调，但却是富有同情心的领导的根源。
- 专心地听。 如果你能听到你的员工以开放的心态和学习的意愿，你不仅会变得更聪明，你也会更有能力帮助他。
- 做好服务的准备。 无论什么时候，当你要和你团队中的某个人交往时，花点时间想想他们之间可能发生的事情。 然后问自己：他们可能需要什么支持？ 准备好提供帮助。
- 拓展人们的潜能。 当某人已经做得很好的时候，你可能会担心强迫他们做更多的事情会令人泄气或失去活力。 与其回避这些令人不舒服的谈话，不如把它们重塑为真正关爱的象征。 挑战人的成长最终是一种善意。
