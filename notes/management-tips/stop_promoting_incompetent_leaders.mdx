## Tip

There are too many incompetent men in leadership positions — in large part because businesses tend to promote people on the basis of charisma, confidence, and even narcissism.

Instead, companies should be putting people in charge who demonstrate competence, humility, and integrity. If you’re responsible for assessing leadership candidates, you should work on your ability to distinguish between confidence and competence. Remember that overconfidence is a natural result of privilege, which is often linked to gender.

Fortunately, you can use scientifically valid assessments to measure the traits you want (or don’t want) in your leaders. You can ask company leaders, including emerging leaders, to take self-assessments, and then measure their responses against their leadership style, performance, and effectiveness.

The resulting data will help identify patterns that characterize good and bad leaders at your company. Of course, this practice will take time and effort, and many organizations won’t want to invest those resources. But vetting candidates for leadership roles will pay dividends down the line.

领导岗位上有太多无能的人，很大程度上是因为企业倾向于基于魅力、自信甚至自恋来提拔员工。

相反，公司应该让那些表现出能力、谦逊和正直的人担任主管。如果你负责评估领导候选人，你应该努力提高自己区分自信和能力的能力。记住，过度自信是特权的自然结果，通常与性别有关。

幸运的是，你可以用科学有效的评估来衡量你想要(或不想要)领导者的哪些特质。你可以要求公司领导，包括新兴的领导，进行自我评估，然后根据他们的领导风格、表现和有效性来衡量他们的反应。

由此得到的数据将有助于识别出公司中好坏领导者的特征。当然，这种实践将花费时间和精力，而且许多组织不愿意投资这些资源。但对领导职位的候选人进行审查将带来好处。
