## Tip

360-degree reviews can be an effective way to develop leaders. But they’re time-consuming and expensive, and the final report is often read and never discussed again, which doesn’t do anyone any good. So how do you ensure a successful 360-review process?

First, the leader should help `choose which colleagues receive the survey`. They know who will have the most useful insight into their performance.

They should then `personally communicate with the respondents, asking them to provide their candid observations`, so those who are providing feedback know it’s welcome.

Once the input is aggregated, `don’t simply send a report to the leader`. Share the results in a coaching conversation, so the leader has the context and guidance to understand the data.

And, ideally, the company should `create a customized set of recommendations`, mapped to its leadership competencies, so the leader has a personal development plan.

`Accountability is critical`, so make sure it’s clear who — whether it’s their direct supervisor or someone in HR — will follow up with the leader to make sure they’ve acted on the feedback they received.

全方位的评估是培养领导者的有效途径。但这既费时又费钱，而且最后的报告往往是只读不谈，这对任何人都没有好处。那么，如何确保全方位评审过程的成功呢？

首先，领导应该帮助选择接受调查的同事。他们知道谁对他们的表现最有洞察力。

然后，他们应该亲自与受访者沟通，请他们提供坦率的意见，这样那些提供反馈的人就知道这是受欢迎的。

一旦信息被汇总，不要简单地向领导发送报告。在指导谈话中分享结果，这样领导者就有背景和指导来理解数据。

理想情况下，公司应该根据自己的领导能力制定一套定制化的建议，这样领导者就有了个人发展计划。

问责制至关重要，因此请确保明确谁（无论是他们的直接主管还是人力资源人员）将跟进领导，以确保他们已根据收到的反馈采取行动。
