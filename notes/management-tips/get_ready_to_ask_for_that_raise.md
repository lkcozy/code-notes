## Tip

We all hit those points in our career where we feel like it’s time for a raise. How can you go about asking for one — without alienating your manager?

- The last thing you want to do is surprise your boss with an unexpected request so bring up the topic gradually during one-on-one meetings. For example, you might say, “At some point, I’d love for us to talk about my contributions and what I can do to get to the next level,” and then gauge their reaction.
- Also, see the situation from your manager’s perspective. What are their priorities beyond your career development? They might be thinking about balancing budgets, meeting business targets, managing your peers, and progressing their own career. Before you start the conversation, consider how your work specifically supports those priorities so you can bring those up. Then, prepare a specific ask.
- Do you want a higher salary? A new title? A change in reporting line? A bigger budget or team? Write down these items in order of importance to you, keeping in mind that your manager may have more leeway in certain areas than others. For instance, salary may be more difficult to secure than promotions (or vice versa).
- Finally, managers want to invest in people who are loyal, enthusiastic, and dedicated so think through how you’ll demonstrate your commitment to the team and the company.

   <summary>🇨🇳 准备好要求加薪</summary>

我们都在职业生涯中遇到过这样的时刻，觉得是时候加薪了。你怎样才能在不疏远你的经理的情况下要求加薪呢?

- 你要做的最后一件事就是提出意想不到的要求给老板一个惊喜，所以在一对一的会议中逐步提出这个话题。例如，你可以说:“在某一时刻，我希望我们能谈谈我的贡献，以及我可以做些什么来进入下一阶段，然后评估他们的反应。”
- 同时，要从经理的角度来看待问题。除了你的职业发展，他们的优先事项是什么?他们可能会考虑平衡预算、实现业务目标、管理同事以及发展自己的事业。在你开始谈话之前，考虑一下你的工作是如何特别支持这些优先事项的，这样你就可以把它们提出来。然后，准备一个具体的询问。
- 你想加薪吗?一个新的标题?汇报方式的改变?更大的预算或团队?按照对你的重要性顺序写下这些事项，记住，你的经理在某些方面可能比其他方面有更多的回旋余地。例如，薪水可能比晋升更难保证(反之亦然)。
- 最后，管理者想要投资于忠诚、热情和敬业的员工，所以要想清楚你将如何展示你对团队和公司的承诺。
