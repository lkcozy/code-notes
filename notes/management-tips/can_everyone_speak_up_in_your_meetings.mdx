## Tip

If you want your culture to be more inclusive, start with the way you run meetings. Some employees don’t feel comfortable speaking up in meetings, or they’re likely to get interrupted when they do. That’s why leaders need to make sure everyone feels welcome.

- Send an email before the meeting that invites all attendees to be ready to share as well as listen.

- As people arrive, welcome them by name and make sure everyone has a (literal) seat at the table.

- Let people know they can speak honestly and offer dissenting opinions without fear of retribution.

- During the meeting, <Highlight>keep track of who’s talking</Highlight> — and who’s not.

- If someone hasn’t offered their thoughts, call on them and ask what they think about the topic at hand.

- And if someone is interrupted, step in quickly: “Wait a minute, I want to hear more of what Alejandra has to say.”

Leading meetings this way creates room for everyone to contribute and sets a standard for respect across the group.

要想使自己的文化更具包容性，就从你主持会议的方式做起。有些员工在会议上发言会觉得不自在，或者被打断。这就是为什么领导人需要确保所有人都受到欢迎。

- 在会议开始前发送一封电子邮件，邀请所有与会者准备好分享和聆听。

- 当人们到达时，以名字欢迎他们，并确保每个人在餐桌上都有一个座位。

- 告诉人们，他们可以诚实地说话，并提出不同意见，而不必担心报复。

- 在会议期间，记录谁有发言，谁没发言。

- 如果有人没有提出他们的想法，那就询问他们对当前话题的看法。

- 如果有人被打断了，迅速介入:“等等，我想听听 Alejandra 有什么要说的。”

以这种方式领导会议可以为每个人创造出贡献的空间，并为整个团队树立尊重的标准。
