## Tip

No matter what stage you’re at in your career, one of the most important things you can do is build relationships. But which ones are most important to your future success? Here are five that will help you accelerate your path to a promotion, increase your visibility within an organization, and become the leader you aspire to be.

`Mentor`: Think of a mentor as the north star that will keep you on track when you’re feeling lost at work. They are the one person inside (or outside) of your organization who you can turn to for guidance — whether you are looking to expand your industry knowledge, navigate a difficult conversation, listen to feedback on a project, or get some encouragement when times are tough.

`Sponsor`: While mentors give you advice and perspective, sponsors advocate on your behalf (especially in front of other company leaders) and in some cases, directly bring you career opportunities.

`Partner`: A partner is an ally or peer who can serve as a sounding board to broaden your perspective. This relationship is fueled by trust, a shared drive to succeed, and the recognition that you can do better together.

`Competitor`: Competition between peers is inevitable, and not always unhealthy. When used correctly, a friendly contest can inspire you to perform better, come up with new ideas, and get more done.

`Mentee`: Becoming a mentor will teach you how to bring out the best in others, recognize their strengths, give feedback, and coach. In turn, it will push you to do your own job better and strive for more.

   <summary>🇨🇳 专注于这5种关系来提升你的职业生涯</summary>

无论你处于职业生涯的哪个阶段，你能做的最重要的事情之一就是建立人际关系。但哪些对你未来的成功最重要呢?以下五点可以帮助你加速升职的道路，提高你在公司中的知名度，并成为你渴望成为的领导者。

导师: 把导师看作是一颗北极星，当你在工作中迷失方向时，他会帮助你走上正轨。他们是组织内部(或外部)的一个人，你可以向他们寻求指导，无论你是想扩大你的行业知识，解决困难的对话，倾听项目反馈，还是在困难时期得到一些鼓励。

赞助者: 当导师给你建议和观点时，赞助商代表你的利益(特别是在其他公司领导面前)，在某些情况下，直接给你带来职业机会。

搭档：搭档是一个同盟者或伙伴，他可以作为一个发声板来拓宽你的视野。这种关系的动力来自信任，成功的共同动力，以及你们可以一起做得更好的认可。

竞争对手：同行之间的竞争是不可避免的，并不总是不健康的。如果使用得当，一个友好的比赛可以激励你表现得更好，提出新的想法，并得到更多的工作。

学员：成为导师将教会你如何发挥他人的长处，认识他们的长处，给予反馈和指导。反过来，他会推动你把自己的工作做得更好，争取更多。
