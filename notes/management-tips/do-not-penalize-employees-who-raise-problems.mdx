## Tip

Divergent, dissident voices are critical to growth and innovation. Yet some leaders demonize anyone who raises problems, afraid of what those naysayers might be pointing out.When you do this, however, you prevent the organization from growing and discourage others from speaking up when they see problems or opportunities.

- So instead of blaming someone for raising an uncomfortable topic, celebrate them for having the courage to bring it up.
- Focus on the underlying problem, not the messenger who called it out. Don’t say “I hear you have a problem.” Say, “I appreciate your helping us to get better.”
- If you suspect people aren’t bringing you problems, consider why not. Maybe they think that you’ll dismiss their concerns or that you won’t take action.
- To set the right tone, celebrate hard-fought, newly learned things, rather than the most popular or most productive things that happened at your firm.

When you do this, your employees will understand that you value innovation and creativity more than you value looking good, and that you genuinely want the company to get better.

   <summary>🇨🇳 不要惩罚那些提出问题的员工</summary>

差异与分歧是成长与创新的关键。然而，有些领导人妖魔化任何提出问题的人，害怕那些反对者可会指出问题。然而，如果你这样做了，就会阻碍公司的发展，也会 f 妨碍其他人在看到问题或机会时畅所欲言。

- 因此，与其责怪某人提出一个令人不快的话题，不如赞扬他们有勇气这样做.
- 关注潜在的问题，而不是提问题的人。别说“我听说你有问题。”说:“谢谢你帮助我们变得更好。”
- 如果你怀疑别人没有提出问题，分析一下原因。或许他们认为你忽视了他们的担忧，或者你不会采取行动。
- 定下正确的基调，庆祝你努力奋斗、学到的新东西，而非公司里最流行或最有成效的事情。

当你这样做的时候，你的员工就会明白，比起外表，你更看重创新和创造力，而你真诚地希望公司变得更好。
