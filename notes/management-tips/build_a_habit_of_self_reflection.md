## Tip

Reflection — looking back on your day (without bias or regret) to contemplate your behavior and its consequences — helps develop your emotional intelligence.

If you want to `build a regular habit of reflecting, keep a journal`. Whenever you are surprised or frustrated, pause and note the feeling.

Then, as soon as you are able — perhaps for fifteen minutes at the end of each workday — `jot down what happened`. Try to identify the “why” behind the emotion. What about the event triggered these feelings in you? Did things not go your way? Did you make a mistake?

Next, `set an hour aside each week to review your notes`. Block out the time on your calendar and take an honest and rigorous look at where you’ve been mentally and emotionally.

Finally, `don’t just re-read your journal entry;add to it.` In retrospect, are there things about the situation that you’re able to see differently?

`Press yourself`. What went wrong? Were your initial observations correct or do they reveal something else that may have been going on, something you couldn’t see in the heat of the moment? Try to think of yourself as a neutral observer. And go easy on yourself.

`Reflection can be ego-bruising`. Always remember that excellence is achieved by stumbling, standing up, dusting yourself off, then stumbling again. If you study those stumbles, you’re much less likely to stumble the same way again.

   <summary>🇨🇳 养成自我反省的习惯 </summary>

反省——回顾你的一天（没有偏见或后悔），思考你的行为及其后果——有助于发展你的情商。

如果你想养成经常反思的习惯，那就写日记吧。每当你感到惊讶或沮丧时，停下来并记录下这种感觉。

然后，当你有能力的时候——也许是在每一天结束的时候——记录下发生了什么。 试着找出情绪背后的“原因”。 这件事在你身上引发了什么感觉？ 事情对你不利吗？ 你弄错了吗？

接下来，每周留出一个小时来复习笔记。 在你的日程表上划出你的时间，用诚实和严谨的眼光看待你在精神上和情感上的经历。

最后，不要只是重读你的日记条目，要加进去。 现在回想起来，你能从不同的角度看待问题吗？

给自己压力。到底是哪里出了错?你最初的观察是正确的吗?或者它们揭示了一些其他可能正在发生的事情，一些你在最激动的时候看不到的事情?试着把自己想象成一个中立的观察者。对自己宽容点。

反思会伤害自尊。永远记住，卓越是通过跌倒、站起来、掸去身上的灰尘、然后再次跌倒而获得的。如果你研究这些错误，你就不太可能再犯同样的错误。
