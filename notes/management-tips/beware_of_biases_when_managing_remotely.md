## Tip

As many leaders have learned over the last year, managing a remote team is hard. When you’re not in the same physical space as your employees, you may jump to conclusions that you wouldn’t have if you were all in the office together. It’s important to watch out for `common biases` that can creep in.

For example,`people are more likely to rely on their own judgment and to forgo asking others for feedback when working remotely`. As a result, the danger for `confirmation bias`— the self-rewarding ways we search for and interpret information that confirms our beliefs and values — increases. So encourage your employees to `gather more points of view` when working on a project, even if this prolongs the decision-making process.

Similarly, `keep an eye out for groupthink`. In virtual meetings, employees are often less willing to speak up, voice criticism, or question opinions, which can distort decision-making. You can counteract this tendency by encouraging critical discussions in breakout rooms before sharing insights with the whole team. This can help team members feel more comfortable speaking up.

   <summary>🇨🇳 远程管理时要注意偏见</summary>

正如许多领导者在过去一年中所了解到的，管理一个远程团队是困难的。当你和你的员工不在同一个物理空间时，你可能会得出结论，如果你们都在办公室里，你就不会有这样的结论。重要的是要警惕可能蔓延的普遍偏见。

例如，当远程工作时，人们更有可能依靠自己的判断，而不愿征求别人的反馈。因此，确认偏见的危险性（我们寻找和解释确认我们的信仰和价值观的信息的自我回报方式）增加了。

同样，要注意群体思维。在虚拟会议中，员工通常不太愿意发言、提出批评或质疑意见，这可能会扭曲决策。在与整个团队分享见解之前，你可以通过鼓励在分组讨论室进行批判性讨论来抵消这种趋势。这可以帮助团队成员更轻松地说出自己的想法。
