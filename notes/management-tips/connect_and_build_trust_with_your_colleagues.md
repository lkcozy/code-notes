## Tip

So much of our success depends on building relationships with our colleagues. But how can you build rapport in an authentic way? Here are four strategies.

- `Find ways to make yourself well rounded`. You need something to talk about with your colleagues so it’s important to have interests and hobbies. Is there something you’ve always wanted to learn? A book you've been meaning to read or a show you've been meaning to watch? Having experience and knowledge in a variety of topics can give you material to draw from when you’re meeting and connecting with others.
- `Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not`. Say your new colleague is a wine expert. Instead of hurriedly purchasing a book all about wine — or signing up for a course — in hopes of passing yourself off as a fellow expert, consider expressing your interest in learning more. Placing yourself in the role of student and the other person in the role of teacher can be a great way to build a genuine bond.
- `Give to get`. In order to get people talking, sometimes you need to give some information about yourself first.
- `Take notes`. People feel special when you remember details they’ve told you about their life and even more so when you follow up. Jot down some key points about someone after you've met them so that you won't forget.

我们的成功很大程度上取决于与同事建立关系。 但是你怎样才能建立一种真正的融洽关系呢？ 以下有四个策略。

- 想办法让自己全面发展。你需要和你的同事谈论一些事情，所以有兴趣和爱好是很重要的。 有什么是你一直想学的吗？ 一本你一直想看的书，或者一个你一直想看的节目？ 在各种各样的话题中有丰富的经验和知识，可以让你在与他人会面和交流时从中汲取经验。
- 不要假装成另一个人。与其匆忙买一本关于葡萄酒的书，或者报名参加一个课程，希望自己能冒充专家，不如考虑表达你想要学习更多知识的兴趣。把你自己放在学生的角色上，把另一个人放在老师的角色上，这是建立真正联系的好方法。
- 为了得到而给予。 为了让别人说话，有时你需要先给自己一些信息。
- 做笔记。 当你回忆起他们告诉你的生活细节时，人们会觉得很特别，当你继续做下去时，感觉更特别。 见过某人之后，记下他们的一些要点，这样你就不会忘记。
