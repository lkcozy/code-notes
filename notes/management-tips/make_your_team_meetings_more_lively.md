## Tip

Think about your last team meeting. Could you predict who was going to speak up and what they were going to say? You’re unlikely to come up with new ideas or have creative breakthroughs if your meetings are “the same old same old.” So stir things up.

First, ground yourselves in a collective purpose. Before changing team dynamics or meeting process, reiterate what the team is trying to achieve and explain why it’s important to shift the way you’re interacting to meet those goals. You might say, “If we want to double our numbers this year, the thinking that leads us to our current figures is unlikely to transform our results. Let’s change the way we’re interacting and brainstorming ideas.”

Then, don’t be afraid to highlight dynamics in the moment, such as who tends to open the conversation or how often the group is developing a consensus. For example, you might say, “In the last 30 minutes, whenever someone from the production group has spoken, they’ve been interrupted by an engineer" or “After two hours in this session, 17 of 43 people have not yet spoken.”By illuminating the patterns at play, you help the group check assumptions and break out of their ruts.

Ask team members to share their thoughts about why certain team dynamics are at play, and what you all can do to disrupt them. Then experiment with those actions to see what works to breathe some new life into your meetings.

   <summary>🇨🇳 让你的团队会议更有活力</summary>

想想你上次的团队会议。 你能预测谁会发言，他们会说些什么吗？ 如果你的会议是“老一套”，你就不太可能想出新点子或者有创造性的突破。 所以把事情搅乱。

首先，你们要有共同的目标。 在改变团队动态或者会议过程之前，重申团队想要达到的目标，并解释为什么改变你的互动方式来达到这些目标很重要。 你可能会说，“如果我们想要今年的数字翻一番，那么导致我们得出当前数字的想法不太可能改变我们的结果。 让我们改变我们交流和集思广益的方式。

然后，不要害怕强调当下的动态，比如谁倾向于打开对话，或者团队形成共识的频率。 例如，你可能会说，“在过去的 30 分钟内，只要生产组的人发言，他们就会被工程师打断”，或者“在这次会议上两个小时后，43 人中有 17 人还没有发言。”通过阐明这些模式，你可以帮助团队检查假设，并打破常规。

请团队成员分享他们的想法，为什么某些团队动态在发挥作用，以及你们所有人都可以做什么来扰乱他们。然后尝试这些行动，看看什么能给你的会议注入新的活力。
