## Tip

Envy can be a powerful motivator, but you shouldn’t let someone else’s accomplishments make you feel inferior. If you find yourself falling into a downward spiral of comparison, there are several things you can do.

First, <Highlight>remind yourself that while you can’t control envy, you can choose whether you feel ashamed about it</Highlight>. Shift from comparison to curiosity: Why has the other person’s career triggered this feeling for you? Instead of assuming that their success somehow detracts from your own, reflect on what their career can teach you about your potential trajectory.

And <Highlight>instead of looking at them as a competitor, think of the person as a potential ally who might help you achieve your goals</Highlight>.

Finally, remember that you’re setting yourself up for disappointment if you let any one job define your self-worth. Instead, <Highlight>imagine your career as a portfolio of experiences that ultimately increase your overall value</Highlight>. While we all experience a little jealousy now and again, these strategies will help lessen your discomfort — and might even help you make your envy work for you.

   <summary>🇨🇳 让职业嫉妒为你服务</summary>
嫉妒是一种强大的动力，但是你不应该让别人的成就让你感到自卑。如果你发现自己陷入了比较的恶性循环，你可以做几件事。

首先，提醒自己，当你无法控制嫉妒的时候，你可以选择是否为此感到羞耻。从比较转向好奇心：为什么别人的职业会激发你的这种感觉？ 与其假设他们的成功会以某种方式影响你，不如反省一下他们的职业生涯能教会你什么关于你的潜在轨迹。

不要把他们看成竞争对手，把他们看成可能帮助你实现目标的潜在盟友。

最后，记住，如果你让任何一份工作来定义你的自我价值，你就是在让自己失望。相反，把你的职业想像成一组最终能增加你整体价值的经历。虽然我们都会时不时地经历一些嫉妒，但这些策略将有助于减轻你的不适——甚至可能帮助你让你的嫉妒为你工作。
