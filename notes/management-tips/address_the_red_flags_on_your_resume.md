## Tip

Resume “red flags,” such as employment gaps, short stints with multiple companies, or unplanned departures, can sound the alarm with a potential employer. When you develop a narrative in which you unapologetically own your decisions, you can proactively address these concerns and make the best possible impression. Here’s how:

- Employment gaps. Explain how you filled your time with relevant activities, consulting, or contract work.
- Job hopping. Focus on your accomplishments rather than your time spent in each role. Emphasize how working alongside different leadership styles has contributed to your professional growth. And highlight how each experience exposed you to best practices in different types of organizations and increased your breadth of knowledge, competence, and adaptability.
- Unplanned departures. Whether you resigned, were laid off, or were fired, leave blame and negativity at the door. Be transparent, and explain concisely what happened, emphasizing the lessons you learned and how they’ve contributed to your professional development.

简历中的“危险信号”，如工作空缺、在多家公司短期任职或计划外离职，都会给潜在雇主敲响警钟。当你在叙述中毫不掩饰地承认自己的决定时，你可以主动解决这些问题，给人留下最好的印象。以下是方法:

- 工作空缺。请说明你如何利用相关活动、咨询或合同工作来充实你的时间的。
- 跳槽。专注于你的成就，而不要花实践在每个角色上。 强调与不同的领导风格并肩工作是如何促进你的职业发展的。着重说明每一次的经历是如何让你接触到各种组织中的最佳实践的，以及增加你的知识、能力和适应性性。
- 意外离职。不管你是辞职，被裁员，还是被解雇，都应该把责任和消极的态度放在门外。要坦诚，简明扼要地解释所发生的事情，强调你学到的经验教训以及它们对你职业发展的贡献。
