## Tip

As a team leader, itâ€™s easy to assume that everyone working together on a project should be treated and managed the same way. But full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors have different motivations, expectations, and needs. As a manager, you need to be conscious of those distinctions and adjust accordingly. Begin by holding one-on-one or small-group discussions with your FTEs, and then with your contractors to understand what people want to get out of the project personally and professionally. With these insights in mind, focus on team-building and alignment. Have a team-wide conversation to ensure that everyone is on the same page about the projectâ€™s overall goals, its organizational context, and the individuals involved â€” and reinforce this alignment throughout the project as needed. Finally, set clear ground rules and guidelines around communication, resources, and roles, aiming to fulfill everyone's distinct needs. This will set clear expectations and ensure that no resentment builds up throughout the project.
