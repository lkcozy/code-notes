## Tip

You’re running a meeting and ask a question, but no one says anything. Crickets. Luckily, in a virtual environment, there are many tools you can use to encourage participation. Next time you’re hoping to get people to speak up in a virtual or hybrid meeting, try these approaches:

- Share your questions ahead of time. If you’re asking people for insight, it’s only fair to give them as much time as possible to think about the problem at hand. Email attendees up to five of the questions you’ll be asking. Place those questions in the meeting agenda and the calendar listing so everyone knows what’s coming and can prepare.
- Ask simple questions in the chat. The key here is simple. Avoid broad questions like “What did you think?” Instead, ask questions that are easy to respond to quickly. Try “What is one word that best describes the product?” or “What is one thing you learned from last week’s event?” Then follow up. You might say, “Kelly, you described the product as innovative. Can you unmute and share why?”
- Avoid shaming. Don’t make your team feel uncomfortable or guilty by saying something like, “Nobody has any questions? Really, nobody?” That increases the chances that you’ll hear relatively meaningless contributions from people who just want to end that awkwardness.

   <summary>🇨🇳 鼓励有意义地参与下一次虚拟会议</summary>

你在主持一个会议，问一个问题，但没有人回答。幸运的是，在虚拟环境中，有许多工具可以用来鼓励参与。下次你希望人们在虚拟会议或混合会议上发言时，可以尝试以下方法:

- 提前分享你的问题。如果你在征求别人的见解，给他们尽可能多的时间来思考手头的问题才是公平的。给与会者发邮件询问你将会问的五个问题。把这些问题列在会议议程和日程表上，这样每个人都能知道接下来会发生什么，并做好准备。
- 在对话中问一些简单的问题。这里的关键是简单。避免泛泛的问题，比如“你是怎么想的？相反，问一些容易回答的问题。试着用”哪个词最能描述这个产品“?或“你从上周的事件中学到了什么?”然后跟进。你可能会说，Kelly，你说这个产品是创新的。你能取消静音并分享原因吗?
- 避免羞辱。不要说“没人有问题吗？”这样的话让你的团队感到不安或内疚。 真的没有人吗？ 这就增加了你从那些只想结束尴尬的人那里听到相对无意义的贡献的机会。
