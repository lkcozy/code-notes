## Tip

Why is breaking a habit so difficult? It’s because habits are made of three components: <Box>a trigger (e.g., feeling stressed)</Box>, <Box>a behaviour (browsing the Internet)</Box> , and <Box>a reward (feeling sated)</Box>. Each time you reinforced the reward, you become more likely to repeat the behaviour. The key to breaking this circle is to become more aware of the reward reinforcing your behaviour.

First, <Highlight>figure out your triggers</Highlight>. If the habit is procrastination, for example, pay attention to the circumstances surrounding you when you put things off. Do you have a big project you try to avoid? Do you have too much on your plate? Then, try to identify the behaviours you engage in when you procrastinate. Do you check social media instead of working? Do you take an unimportant tasks instead of what you should be doing?

The next step is to <Highlight>clearly link action to outcome</Highlight>. Ask yourself what you get from surfing the internet for pictures of cute puppies. How rewarding is it in the moment, especially when you realize that it isn’t helping you get your work done?

Lastly, <Highlight>replace the reward with curiosity</Highlight>. Being curious helps you acknowledge the sensations you’re feeling - boredom, distraction - without acting on them.

The next time you find yourself indulging in a bad habit, take a moment to pause and consider using mindfulness to help you overcome it. <Highlight>Your behaviors may not change immediately — but stick with it</Highlight>. If you can hack your mind using our methods, you will eventually be able to break free of unwanted habits and comfortably watch your cravings pass by.
