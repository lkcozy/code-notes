## Tip

Everyone worries about things like failing, disappointing others, or getting fired or laid off. But this kind of worrying can be dangerous for you and your career. Here are some questions that will help you determine whether or not your fears are grounded in reality:
Whatâ€™s the general financial state of your organization, industry, and economy? If the financial state and outlook of your company or your countryâ€™s economy is poor, your worries may be realistic. If the outlook is good, your job is probably safe.
Whatâ€™s the general culture of your organization? If you have an open, feedback-oriented culture, it will be clear to you if your job is in jeopardy.
How does your manager think and act? If theyâ€™re giving you lots of negative feedback without guidance on how to improve, you should maybe worry â€” especially if your coworkers are not getting the same type of feedback.
What are your own personal biases? If youâ€™re an optimist at heart and you still have a gut feeling that you may lose your job, this may be a realistic worry. But if youâ€™re a pessimist who always expects the worst, take your fears of getting let go with a grain of salt.
