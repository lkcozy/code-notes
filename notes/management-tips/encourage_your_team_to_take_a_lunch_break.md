## Tip

For many of us, the shift to WFH has led to longer workdays, more emails and meetings, and a general dissolution of work-life boundaries. But one thing could help you restore a sense of balance: your lunch break. No matter what stage you’re at in your career, you’ve got to protect your lunch break at all costs. It’s especially important if you work for yourself; if you’re a manager, you have the opportunity to set a visible example. In the remote work environment, that could be creating an “at lunch” notification, mentioning in the team chat that you’ll be away from your screen during lunch, or acknowledging in the afternoon, “I’m back from lunch.” The important thing isn’t the meal itself, it’s demonstrating that it’s okay to take a break. You can use the time to catch up with a friend, step away from your desk, or just zone out for a minute. It may sound overly simplistic, but letting lunch slide is an easy way to burn out, especially in this new world of remote work.
