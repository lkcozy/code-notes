## Tip

Public speaking can be nerve wracking. If you dread it, you’re not alone. The good news is that you can take actions to shift your mindset and assuage your anxiety.

T`hink about being a "giver," not a "taker."` This means focusing on your audience, not yourself. What do your listeners need from you? Your job as a presenter is to help the people in the room (or on Zoom) grow and meet their goals.

`Think of your presentation as an act of service` as opposed to a talent show or self-promotional opportunity. To get into this mindset, choose three to five influential leaders or stakeholders who will be in your audience and meet with them beforehand to ask about their concerns and goals surrounding the topic of your presentation.

Then, `adjust your message accordingly`, with the intention of making sure you’re serving them. This will help you shift your focus outwards, from yourself to the audience, and as a result, ease some of your nerves.

公开演讲可能会使人神经紧张。如果你害怕，你并不孤单。好消息是，你可以采取行动来改变你的心态，减轻你的焦虑。

想想做一个“给予者”，而不是一个“索取者”。这意味着关注你的听众，而不是你自己。你的听众需要你做什么？作为一名演讲者，你的工作就是帮助室内（或 Zoom）的人们成长并实现他们的目标。

把你的演讲看作是一种服务行为，而非才艺表演或自我推销机会。要进入这种思维，选择三到五个有影响力的领导者或利益相关者，他们将在你的听众中，并事先会见他们，询问他们的关注和围绕你的演讲主题的目标。

然后，相应地调整你的信息，以确保你在为他们服务。这将帮助你把注意力从你自己转移到观众身上，从而缓解你的紧张情绪。
