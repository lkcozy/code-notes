## Tip

As a manager, you need to be equipped to handle emotional conversations with your employees — especially these days. Here’s how to be supportive when someone shares that they’re going through a tough situation or challenge.

First, `validate their experience`. This can be as simple as acknowledgement — for example, “I can see why this is exhausting.” You’re not only saying “I see you,” you’re also saying “I believe you,” which can make someone feel less alone.

`Give your colleague the chance to elaborate if they want to`. Try coming from a place of curiosity; for example, you can say “Tell me more about that.” And you might then ask, “How can I best support you right now?” or “What would be helpful right now?” `This will give them the opportunity to name what they need`. If they are unable to do so — or if they’re afraid to — you can give them some options. For example, you can ask “Would X be helpful?” Offering a specific way to support them can make it easier for someone to say yes to accepting help.

Finally, `thank the person for coming to you`. You might say, “I can see this has been hard. Thank you for trusting me with this information.” This signals to both you and them that conversations like this are important and reinforces a sense of safety for future conversations. 

It’s no longer enough for managers to provide the tools and resources for your team to function — you also need to create psychological safety for them to thrive.

作为一名经理，你需要准备好处理与员工之间的情感对话——尤其是在当下。下面是当有人分享他们正在经历的艰难处境或挑战时如何给予支持的方法。

首先，呼应他们的经历。 这可以像承认一样简单，例如，我可以理解为什么这是令人疲惫的。你不仅在说我看到你了，你还在说我相信你，这会让某人感觉不那么孤单。

如果你的同事愿意，你可以给他们机会详细说明。 试着从一个充满好奇心的地方走出来；例如，你可以说“告诉我更多关于它的信息。” 然后你可能会问，“我现在怎样才能最好地支持你？”或者“现在有什么能帮到你？” 这将给他们机会说出他们需要什么。 如果他们不能这样做，或者他们害怕这样做，你可以给他们一些选择。 例如，你可以问“X 会有帮助吗？” 提供一种具体的方式来支持他们，可以让别人更容易接受帮助。

最后，感谢那个人来找你。 你可能会说，“我可以看到这很难。 谢谢你把这些信息交给我。” 这向你和他们发出信号，像这样的谈话很重要，并加强了未来谈话的安全感。 

对于管理者来说，仅仅为你的团队提供运作所需的工具和资源是不够的，你还需要为他们创造心理上的安全感。
