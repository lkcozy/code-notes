## Tip

If youâ€™ve been working from home for most of the past year, you may find yourself hitting a wall. WFH burnout is real â€” so it's important to do what you can to give yourself a boost throughout the workday. Don't underestimate the power of going for a walk (or, if you're unable to walk, spending some time outside). Here are five reasons to walk with purpose.

1. Perspective. Especially in these trying times, getting outside and reconnecting with nature can help broaden your perspective in a healthy way.
2. Connection. Invite a friend or family member to join you in person if itâ€™s doable, safe, and responsible, or over the phone if it isnâ€™t.
3. Learning. Try listening to an audiobook, podcast, or webinar to stimulate your mind with new information.
4. Gratitude. It's easy to get bogged down in the negative these days. What if you used your time outside to focus on what you're thankful for?
5. Productivity. Walking doesn't always have to be a break from work â€” it can just be a break from sitting at your desk all day. Which meetings or phone calls could you do on the go?
