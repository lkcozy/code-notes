## Tip

If you see networking and work interactions as purely transactional, you’re likely missing out on the deeper connections that are often integral to career success and growth. But how can you actually bring your authentic self to these professional interactions?

- Start by trying to think of everyone you come across as a real-life connection, not just a work contact. Shifting your mindset in this way will help you start to build genuine relationships.
- Show interest and be present with your colleagues — even when you don’t need something from them. Listening is the best tool for this. Pay attention to other people’s interests and passions, and follow up when you come across something — a podcast, an article, an internet meme — that reminds you of them.
- Finally, set boundaries. Bringing your true self to work means being vulnerable, and not everyone needs, or deserves, to see that side of you.

You get to decide where and how you express your authentic self. Save your energy for the relationships that you believe will bring you energy and joy.

   <summary>🇨🇳 与同事建立有意义的联系 </summary>

如果你把人际关系和工作交往看作纯粹的事务沟通，那么你很可能会错失更深层次的联系，而这对你的职业成功和成长来说是不可或缺的。 但你怎样才能真正把真实的自己带到职业互动中呢?

首先，试着把你遇到的每个人都看成是现实生活中的联系，而不仅仅是工作上的联系。以这种方式改变你的心态将帮助你开始建立真正的人际关系。

表现出对你的同事感兴趣，并且和他们在一起——即使你并不需要他们提供什么东西。聆听是最好的方式。留意他人的兴趣爱好，当你遇到一些让你想起他们的事情（播客，文章，网络爆红）时跟进。

最后,设定界限。在工作中展现真实的自己意味着你很脆弱，不是每个人都需要，或者值得看到那一面的你。

你要决定在哪里以及如何表达真实的自我。把精力花在那些你相信能给你带来精力和快乐的人际关系上。
