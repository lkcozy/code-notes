## Tip

If you see networking and work interactions as purely transactional, youâ€™re likely missing out on the deeper connections that are often integral to career success and growth. But how can you actually bring your authentic self to these professional interactions?

- Start by trying to think of everyone you come across as a real-life connection, not just a work contact.
- Shifting your mindset in this way will help you start to build genuine relationships.
- Show interest and be present with your colleagues â€” even when you donâ€™t need something from them.
- Listening is the best tool for this. Pay attention to other peopleâ€™s interests and passions, and follow up when you come across something â€” a podcast, an article, an internet meme â€” that reminds you of them.
- Finally, set boundaries. Bringing your true self to work means being vulnerable, and not everyone needs, or deserves, to see that side of you.

You get to decide where and how you express your authentic self. Save your energy for the relationships that you believe will bring you energy and joy.
