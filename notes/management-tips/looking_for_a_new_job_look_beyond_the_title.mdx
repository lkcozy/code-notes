## Tip

What’s the first thing you focus on when searching for a new role? If your answer is "job title," you’re not alone. But job titles are often misleading, and you may ultimately find yourself in a role that’s different from what you expected. To find a job you’ll actually love, try this two-part exercise.

`First, write down your answers to four simple questions`: Who do I want to be around all day? What do I actually want to be doing? Where do I want to do it? And why do I want to do it?

`Then refine your search around your answers`. Type “careers in [your field of interest]” into Google, read or watch interviews with people who have the kind of job you’re looking for, or dive into listings on LinkedIn for the area in which you want to live. Once you find something that seems like a good fit, look for similar roles at other organizations. Compare the job descriptions and note what appeals to you most. And schedule informational interviews with acquaintances or people in your college alumni network who have the role you’re interested in.

Thinking beyond the job title will give you a better chance at landing in a role that’s right for you — even if it’s one you had never imagined yourself doing before.

在寻找新角色时，你首先关注的是什么？如果你的答案是“职称”，你并不孤单。但头衔往往会误导你，最终你可能会发现自己所扮演的角色与你所期望的不同。要找到一份你真正喜欢的工作，试试下面的两个练习。

首先，写下你对四个简单问题的答案:我希望一整天都和谁在一起?我真正想做的是什么?我想在哪里做?我为什么要这么做?

然后围绕你的答案完善你的搜索。在谷歌中输入“[你感兴趣的领域]的职业”，阅读或观看与你正在寻找的工作类型相同的人的采访，或者在 LinkedIn 上搜索你想居住的领域。一旦你找到了合适的职位，就在其他公司寻找类似的职位。比较工作描述，注意什么最吸引你。安排与熟人或大学校友网络中有你感兴趣职位的人进行信息面试。

考虑工作头衔之外的问题会给你更好的机会找到适合自己的职位——即使这是一个你以前从没想过自己会做的工作。
