## Tip

Research shows that having a strong work identity can be tied to your well-being. But losing your job can feel particularly destabilizing when your identity is intertwined with your career. Here are several ways to start the process of regaining â€” and even redefining â€” your sense of self:

- Reach out to family and friends. Conversations with people who know and love you can remind you of your identity outside of your professional life.

- Test your perspective. If you're feeling stuck after losing a job you love, it may be because you're seeing your value through a singular and fixed lens. Ask two mentors or colleagues you respect what they value about you. Chances are, their answers won't have anything to do with work.

- Envision your future self. Your situation isn't static â€” and neither is your identity. The more you plan and set goals for your future self, the more your behavior will shift from reactive toward proactive.

- Get the support you need. A trained coach or therapist can help you examine, learn from, and move past this experience â€” and toward future success.
