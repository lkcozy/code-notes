## Tip

Research shows that having a strong work identity can be tied to your well-being. But losing your job can feel particularly destabilizing when your identity is intertwined with your career. Here are several ways to start the process of regaining — and even redefining — your sense of self:

- Reach out to family and friends. Conversations with people who know and love you can remind you of your identity outside of your professional life.

- Test your perspective. If you're feeling stuck after losing a job you love, it may be because you're seeing your value through a singular and fixed lens. Ask two mentors or colleagues you respect what they value about you. Chances are, their answers won't have anything to do with work.

- Envision your future self. Your situation isn't static — and neither is your identity. The more you plan and set goals for your future self, the more your behavior will shift from reactive toward proactive.

- Get the support you need. A trained coach or therapist can help you examine, learn from, and move past this experience — and toward future success.

   <summary>🇨🇳 失业后恢复自我意识 </summary>

研究表明，强烈的工作认同感与你的健康息息相关。但是当你的身份和你的职业纠缠在一起时，失去工作会让你感觉特别不稳定。这里有几种方法可以帮助你开始恢复甚至重新定义自我意识。

- 联系家人和朋友。与认识你、爱你的人交谈，会让你想起你在职业生活之外的身份。
- 测试你的观点。如果你在失去自己喜欢的工作后感到不知所措，这可能是因为你通过一个单一和固定的视角看到了自己的价值。问问两位导师或你尊敬的同事，他们看重你哪些方面。很有可能，他们的答案与工作无关。
- 想象未来的自己。你的处境不是一成不变的——你的身份也不是一成不变的。你为未来的自己规划和设定的目标越多，你的行为就会从被动转向主动。
- 获得你需要的支持。一个训练有素的教练或治疗师可以帮助你检查，从这些经验中学习，走出过去，走向未来的成功。
