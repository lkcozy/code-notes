## Tip

Resume “red flags,” such as employment gaps, short stints with multiple companies, or unplanned departures, can sound the alarm with a potential employer. When you develop a narrative in which you unapologetically own your decisions, you can proactively address these concerns and make the best possible impression. Here’s how:
Employment gaps. Explain how you filled your time with relevant activities, consulting, or contract work.
Job hopping. Focus on your accomplishments rather than your time spent in each role. Emphasize how working alongside different leadership styles has contributed to your professional growth. And highlight how each experience exposed you to best practices in different types of organizations and increased your breadth of knowledge, competence, and adaptability.
Unplanned departures. Whether you resigned, were laid off, or were fired, leave blame and negativity at the door. Be transparent, and explain concisely what happened, emphasizing the lessons you learned and how they’ve contributed to your professional development.
