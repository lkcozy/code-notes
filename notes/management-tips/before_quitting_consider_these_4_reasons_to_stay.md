## Tip

It might feel like everyone is quitting their jobs right now and you might be tempted to follow in their footsteps, but don’t act rashly. It’s important to take a hard look at whether leaving your current organization is in fact the best way to achieve your long-term career goals. Here are some reasons you may want to stick around for a while longer.

- `You have a mentor or sponsor in place`. If you’re lucky enough to have someone advocating for you at this time, it may be worthwhile to double down, work hard, and let them know how committed you are to the company. During times of change and turnover, they may invest more in you, even putting your name forward when opportunities come up.
- `Opportunities are opening up`. With lots of people leaving, there’s a good amount of shuffling inside more organizations. These shifts could result in new projects, roles, or responsibilities that you could take on.
- `You’re crushing your goals`. If you’re excelling — solving tough problems, knocking your tasks out of the park, and earning a standout reputation for your efforts — why leave now? Stick around to reap the benefits of your stellar performance.
- `You have leverage to negotiate`. Now is a great time to discuss pay, workplace flexibility, and development opportunities like leadership training and coaching support. Talk to your boss about what you want your future to look like at your company.

   <summary>🇨🇳 在辞职之前，考虑一下这四个留下来的理由</summary>

你可能会觉得现在每个人都在辞职，你可能会想要步他们的后尘，但不要轻率行事。 认真考虑一下离开目前的公司是否是实现长期职业目标的最佳途径，这一点很重要。下面是一些你可能想多呆一段时间的原因。

- 你有一个导师或赞助者。 如果你很幸运，有人在这个时候支持你，那么你应该加倍努力，让他们知道你对公司有多投入。 在变化和更替的时候，他们可能会在你身上投入更多，甚至在机会来临时把你的名字提出来。
- 机会正在出现。 随着大量的人离开，更多的组织内部出现了大量的变动。 这些转变可能会产生新的项目、角色或职责，你可以承担。
- 你正在粉碎你的目标。 如果你表现出色——解决棘手的问题，完成任务，为你的努力赢得声誉——为什么现在就离开呢？ 留下来享受你出色的表现所带来的好处吧。
- 你有谈判的筹码。 现在是讨论薪酬、职场灵活性以及领导力培训和教练支持等发展机会的好时机。 和你的老板谈谈你希望你的公司的未来是什么样子。
