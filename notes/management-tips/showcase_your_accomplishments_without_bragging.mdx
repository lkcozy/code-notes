## Tip

Success at work often depends on being — and being seen as — both competent and likable. You need people to notice your growth and accomplishments while also enjoying your company. But how do you showcase your work without coming across as a shameless self-promoter? Here’s a few tips:

Share when asked. Humility is admirable. But if someone requests information or an answer that requires you to reveal positives about yourself, you should oblige. Research indicates that when someone details an accomplishment in response to a direct question, others don’t judge that person as any less agreeable.

Share when others are sharing. The penalty for bragging seems to dissipate when others in the room are engaging in self-promotion.

Find a promoter. Peers, bosses, mentors, and sponsors will likely be happy to speak up on your behalf if and when you ask them to.

   <summary>🇨🇳 展示你的成就，但不要吹嘘 </summary>

工作上的成功通常取决于自己的能力和受欢迎程度。你需要人们注意到你的成长和成就，同时享受你的陪伴。但你如何展示自己的工作，又不让人觉得你是个无耻的自我推销者呢?这里有一些建议。

被问及时才分享。谦逊是令人钦佩的。但是，如果有人要求你提供一些信息或一个需要你展现自己积极一面的答案，你应该照办。研究表明，当一个人在回答一个直接的问题时详细描述一个成就时，其他人不会认为这个人不那么讨人喜欢。

当别人分享时也分享。当房间里的其他人都在进行自我推销时，自夸的惩罚似乎就烟消云散了。

找一个发起人。 同事、老板、导师和赞助商可能会很乐意代表你发言，如果你要求他们这样做的话。
