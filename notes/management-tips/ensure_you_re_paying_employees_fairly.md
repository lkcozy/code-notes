## Tip

As a leader, one of the most important questions you can — and should — ask yourself is: "Am I paying my employees fairly?" To answer this question, you may need to conduct a pay equity audit (PEA).

This means comparing the pay of employees doing “like for like” work (accounting for reasonable differentials, such as work experience, credentials, and job performance), and investigating the causes of any pay differences that cannot be justified.

If your organization is small (50+ employees), you may delegate this audit to HR. Or, if your organization is large (500+ employees), it may be a better practice to hire a consulting firm that specializes in pay and rewards.

According to a 2019 study, most companies find that up to 5% of employees are eligible for an increase. Addressing pay inequity in your organization isn't just a moral imperative; it's crucial for your competitiveness, shareholder expectations, and legal compliance.

作为一名领导者，你可以也应该问自己的一个最重要的问题是:“我给员工的薪酬公平吗?”要回答这个问题，你可能需要进行薪酬公平审计(PEA)。

这意味着比较做“相似工作”的员工的薪酬（计算合理的差异，如工作经验、证书和工作表现），并调查任何无法证明合理的薪酬差异的原因。

如果您的组织规模较小(50 名以上员工)，您可以将审计工作委托给人力资源部门。或者，如果你的组织规模很大(500 多名员工)，聘请专门从事薪酬和奖励的咨询公司可能是一个更好的做法。

根据 2019 年的一项研究，大多数公司发现高达 5%的员工有资格获得加薪。 解决组织中的薪酬不平等问题不仅仅是道义上的当务之急，它对你的竞争力、股东期望和法律遵从也至关重要。
