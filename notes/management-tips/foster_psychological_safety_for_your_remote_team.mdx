## Tip

Research shows that high-performing teams have a sense of psychological safety, which means employees feel they can speak up, ask for help, and offer ideas without being punished or ostracized. Here are some ways to promote psychological safety on your team, especially if youâ€™re remote:
Ask questions. Proactively check in and show curiosity about your employeesâ€™ lives outside of work.
Show vulnerability. Share your professional and personal experiences and encourage your employees to do the same.
Build a sense of collective responsibility. Invite team members to participate in meetings by asking: What do you think? Whatâ€™s your perception of this? What are we missing?
Encourage risk. Give employees the latitude to try out new ideas, pitch new projects or processes, and experiment on the fly.
