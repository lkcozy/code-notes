## Tip

Research shows that high-performing teams have a sense of psychological safety, which means employees feel they can speak up, ask for help, and offer ideas without being punished or ostracized. Here are some ways to promote psychological safety on your team, especially if you’re remote:

Ask questions. Proactively check in and show curiosity about your employees’ lives outside of work.

Show vulnerability. Share your professional and personal experiences and encourage your employees to do the same.

Build a sense of collective responsibility. Invite team members to participate in meetings by asking: What do you think? What’s your perception of this? What are we missing?

Encourage risk. Give employees the latitude to try out new ideas, pitch new projects or processes, and experiment on the fly.

研究表明，高绩效团队有一种心理安全感，这意味着员工觉得他们可以说出自己的想法，寻求帮助，提出想法，而不会受到惩罚或排斥。这里有一些方法可以促进你的团队的心理安全，尤其是当你远程工作时：

- 提出问题。主动了解员工工作之外的生活，并表现出好奇心。
- 显示的脆弱性。分享你的专业和个人经验，并鼓励你的员工也这样做。
- 树立集体责任感。邀请团队成员参加会议时可以问:你怎么想?你对此的看法是什么?我们遗漏了什么?
- 鼓励风险。给员工自由，让他们尝试新想法、推介新项目或新流程，并随时进行试验。
