## Tip

Nearly a year into the pandemic, it can be hard to muster the positive outlook that fuels motivation and creativity. When we lose that positivity, burnout and fatigue can quickly follow. How can you inject some optimism into your day? This two-minute exercise can help. Each morning, finish the following three sentences (either on paper, out loud, or even in your head) before you turn on your computer or start your commute:

Today, I will focus on **\_**.

Today, I am grateful for **\_**.

Today, I will let go of **\_**.

Make sure to be specific with your answers; writing that youâ€™re grateful for your mom every day wonâ€™t help. Ultimately, weâ€™re only awake for an average of 1,000 minutes each day. If we can invest just two of them to prime our brains for positivity, then weâ€™ll be helping ensure the quality of other 998 minutes.
