## Tip

One of your best employees has quit. What can you do to ensure that they're not the first of many dominoes to fall?

**The most important thing is to listen — carefully**. `Conduct an exit interview` to find out what factors led to their decision, and encourage full transparency in that conversation.

Then, **take the pulse of your team**. Meet with employees individually and talk to them about how they’re doing. Ask how they think the departure of their colleague will affect morale. If these conversations `uncover` a significant problem, `acknowledge` your team’s concerns and be transparent about your attempts to address the issues they’ve raised.

And in the team meetings that follow, **stay focused on future opportunities and your collective goals**. This will reinforce the sense that the team’s most important work lies ahead and that everyone is valued.

The bottom line is if you **respond to the departure of a valuable employee by being attentive and looking toward the future**, you'll be more likely to keep your team intact and move ahead together.

   <summary>🇨🇳 明星员工离职后该怎么办</summary>

你最佳员工之一辞职了。 为了确保他们不是第一个倒下的多米诺骨牌，你能做些什么？

最重要的是认真倾听。进行离职面谈，找出导致他们做出决定的因素，并鼓励坦诚交流。

然后，摸清团队现状。与员工单独会面，和他们谈谈他们的工作情况。 询问同事的离职对士气的影响。如果这些对话暴露了一个重要的问题，承认你的团队的疑虑，并公开你试图解决他们提出的问题。

在随后的团队会议上，集中讨论未来的机会和集体目标。这将加强团队最重要的工作就在前面的感觉，每个人都被重视。

最重要的是，如果你对一名有价值的员工离职的反应是专注和面向未来，你就更有可能保持你的团队完整，并共同前进。
