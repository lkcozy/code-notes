## Tip

A gap on your resume doesn’t have to be an obstacle to overcome. You can reframe a break from traditional employment as a valuable learning experience.

Start by challenging your assumption that employers only value the skills you developed in paid positions.In fact, they often look for applicants who can demonstrate their ability to problem solve and get things done. You can showcase these skills whether or not they are tied to a long-term, 9-to-5 job. Write down everything you’ve spent time on in between jobs: Maybe you took part in a startup competition during school or helped a friend create a social media campaign for their new Etsy store.

Then, ask yourself, “Have I gained any skills that align with the requirements for the job I'm applying for?” You might think that a project has nothing to do with your job search, but if framed right, it could actually add a great deal to your resume.

Ultimately, if you’re confident in the value that you can bring to others, your dynamic experience will be seen as the asset that it is.

   <summary>🇨🇳 重塑你简历上的空白 </summary>

简历上的空白期不需要成为你克服的障碍。你可以把从传统工作中抽身出来的一次休息重新定义为一次宝贵的学习经历。

首先，你要挑战自己的假设，即雇主只看重你在带薪岗位上培养的技能。事实上，他们经常寻找那些能够证明他们解决问题和完成事情的能力的申请人。无论这些技能是否与长期朝九晚五的工作有关，你都可以展示它们。写下你在两份工作之间所做的每一件事:也许你在校期间参加了创业竞赛，或者帮朋友为他们的新 Etsy 商店在社交媒体上发起了活动。

然后，问问自己，“我获得了与我申请的职位要求相匹配的技能了吗?”你可能认为项目与你的求职无关，但如果框架正确，它实际上可以为你的简历增添很多东西。

最终，如果你对自己能给他人带来的价值有信心，你的动态经验就会被视为一种资产。
