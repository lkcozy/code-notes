A gap on your resume doesn’t have to be an obstacle to overcome. You can reframe a break from traditional employment as a valuable learning experience. Start by challenging your assumption that employers only value the skills you developed in paid positions. In fact, they often look for applicants who can demonstrate their ability to problem solve and get things done. You can showcase these skills whether or not they are tied to a long-term, 9-to-5 job. Write down everything you’ve spent time on in between jobs: Maybe you took part in a startup competition during school or helped a friend create a social media campaign for their new Etsy store. Then, ask yourself, “Have I gained any skills that align with the requirements for the job I'm applying for?” You might think that a project has nothing to do with your job search, but if framed right, it could actually add a great deal to your resume. Ultimately, if you’re confident in the value that you can bring to others, your dynamic experience will be seen as the asset that it is.
