## Tip

Working for a passive-aggressive manager can be extremely frustrating and demoralizing. Maybe your boss passes you off to someone else when you approach them with a problem, continuously finds gentle ways to shut down your ideas without a thoughtful explanation, or even ignores you when you speak. How can you navigate this kind of tricky relationship?

- Build a supportive network. Because a passive-aggressive manager doesn’t confront you directly, it’s easy to second-guess yourself and believe you’re inventing slights. People outside of your organization will be able to offer you a fresh, unbiased perspective, emotional support, and sage advice on how to deal with your boss.
- Don't stoop to their level. You don’t want to earn a negative reputation with your other colleagues so avoid gossiping. But it’s ok to reach out to others if you’re actively and constructively looking for solutions.
- Network internally. Should you want to switch teams or departments at some point, it’s a good idea to make connections in other parts of the company.
- Know when it's time to leave. Once you’ve exhausted all of your options, it might be time to look for greener pastures. Prioritize your well-being and career above all else.

   <summary>🇨🇳 没有人愿意为一个消极好斗的经理工作 </summary>

为一个消极好斗的经理工作是非常令人沮丧和泄气的。也许当你向老板提出问题时，他会把你交给其他人处理。不断地用温和的方式拒绝你的想法，而没有给出经过深思熟虑的解释。甚至在你说话时忽略你。你该如何处理这种棘手的关系？

- 建立一个支持性的网络。因为一个消极好斗的经理不会直接面对你，所以你很容易怀疑自己，并认为你是在制造怠慢。公司之外的人会给你提供新颖、公正的观点、情感支持，以及如何与老板相处的明智建议。
- 不要同流合污。你不想在其他同事中留下不好的名声，所以要避免说闲话。但是，如果你积极地、有建设性地寻找解决方案，那么与他人接触是可以的。
- 在公司内部建立人脉。如果你想在某个时候更换团队或部门，与公司的其他部门建立联系是一个好主意。
- 知道什么时候该离开。一旦你用尽了所有的选择，也许是时候去寻找更好的机会了。将你的幸福和事业置于其他一切之上。
