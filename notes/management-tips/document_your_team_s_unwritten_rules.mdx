## Tip

Every workplace has unwritten rules — the unstated cultural and emotional norms that dictate what’s acceptable on your team or in your company. But is everyone aware of them? Do they know if it’s okay to turn off their video during a Zoom meeting? Or to go for a walk in the middle of the day? During stressful times it can be helpful for everyone to know exactly what your norms are. So write them down.

Set aside time for you and your team to brainstorm an “It’s okay to…” list to clarify the small uncertainties that can add unnecessary stress. Your list can include things like "It's okay to say you don't understand a process," or, "It's okay to have quiet days."

If your company has moved to remote work during the pandemic, you might want to refresh your list, including things like, "It's okay to shift your hours to take care of family commitments," or “It’s okay to block off calendar time for focused work.”

Documenting these norms is a simple exercise that has positive benefits for new, tenured, and future employees — and allows you to reinforce your culture even when the nature of work changes.

每个工作场所都有不成文的规则——未成文的文化和情感规范，这些规范决定了你的团队或你的公司能接受什么。但是大家都知道吗? 是否能在 Zoom 会议上关闭视频呢? 中午可以出去散步吗? 在压力大的时候，让每个人都确切地知道你的标准是什么会对你有帮助。因此，将其写下来。

给你和你的团队留出集思广益的时间，列出一份“可以……”的清单，澄清一些可能增加不必要压力的小不确定因素。以澄清那些可能增加不必要压力的小的不确定性。

列表中可以包含诸如“可以说你不了解某个流程”或“可以度过一个安静的日子”等内容。

如果你的公司在流感大流行期间转向了远程工作，你可能需要更新你的清单，包括“可以把时间用来处理家庭事务”或“可以把日程安排在重点工作上”等。

将这些规范文档化是一个简单的方法，可以对新员工、在职员工和未来的员工带来积极的益处，甚至在工作性质发生变化时，还可以增强自己的文化。
