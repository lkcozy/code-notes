## Tip

Every workplace has unwritten rules — the unstated cultural and emotional norms that dictate what’s acceptable on your team or in your company. But is everyone aware of them? Do they know if it’s okay to turn off their video during a Zoom meeting? Or to go for a walk in the middle of the day? During stressful times it can be helpful for everyone to know exactly what your norms are. So write them down.

Set aside time for you and your team to brainstorm an “It’s okay to…” list to clarify the small uncertainties that can add unnecessary stress. Your list can include things like "It's okay to say you don't understand a process," or, "It's okay to have quiet days."

If your company has moved to remote work during the pandemic, you might want to refresh your list, including things like, "It's okay to shift your hours to take care of family commitments," or “It’s okay to block off calendar time for focused work.”

Documenting these norms is a simple exercise that has positive benefits for new, tenured, and future employees — and allows you to reinforce your culture even when the nature of work changes.
