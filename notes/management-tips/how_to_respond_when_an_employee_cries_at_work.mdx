## Tip

People cry at work. Maybe it’s because of tough feedback or a particularly stressful day, or maybe it has nothing at all to do with work. Regardless of the reason, as a manager, you shouldn’t ignore or diminish the tears, even if they make you feel uncomfortable.<Highlight> Don’t try to interpret your employee’s emotions, tell them what to do, or judge them</Highlight>. Instead, show gentle curiosity and compassion. Try saying something
like: “Let’s pause for a moment here. I can see you’re crying. Would you like to
take a break or keep going? It’s up to you.” <Highlight>This neutral language gives the person a chance to take a second and claim some privacy</Highlight>.

You can also say: “I’m going to stop our conversation for a second to check in with you. You can talk to me about what’s going on if you’re comfortable.” <Highlight>This demonstrates curiosity, without dramatizing or overplaying concern</Highlight>. Or, try: “You’re crying, so let’s pause. What would be most helpful for you right now? I’ll follow your lead.” This acknowledges what’s happening in a nonjudgmental way, while empowering the person to take control.

Whatever you choose to say, <Highlight>the key is to be clear, understanding, and ultimately allow the person to tell you what they need</Highlight>.
