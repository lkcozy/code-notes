## Tip

There are many reasons an employee might mentally check out. They could be experiencing burnout or a personal issue, or they could be totally unaware that theyâ€™ve been slipping. Before you initiate a conversation, learn about any available support systems â€” including employee resource groups, assistance plans, and health networks â€” that could help your employee if they need it. Next ask yourself: What are the specific requirements of the job that this person is not meeting? Be ready to present this evidence. Then, open an honest and empathetic dialogue. Give your employee a chance to tell you whatâ€™s going on before sharing your assessment of their performance. Be compassionate and make it clear you have a sincere desire to support them. Then discuss your priorities, be straightforward and specific about your concerns, and come up with a plan to re-engage them in their work. You need to be patient â€” but to a point. Lighting a spark under a disengaged employee wonâ€™t happen overnight. But if an employee is truly checked out, it ultimately might not be the right role for them.
