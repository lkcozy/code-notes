## Tip

You plan a vacation to relax, rejuvenate, and forget all about work. But being out of the office often means doing a mountain of extra work before and after, so your supposedly relaxing time off can actually exacerbate your stress. How do you avoid this problem?

Before your vacation, `overcommunicate and delegate`. Make a prioritized list of tasks that need to be done during your time off and establish a hand-off process for each one, coordinating with anyone who will be filling in while you’re away.Then send out advanced notice of your vacation to anyone who might be impacted so they’re all aware of how long you’ll be gone and who to go to in your absence.

During your vacation, `set an intention`: are you trying to relax, learn about a new culture, or connect with friends and family? Think of this intention as your only job during your time off — and give yourself permission to unplug from work so you can focus on achieving it.

Finally, `when you return from vacation`, take the first thirty minutes of your first day back to `make a list of priorities`, ideally before you open your inbox. Then tackle your new to-do list one-item at a time.

Remember: you deserve a restorative vacation. You don’t deserve additional stress for taking it.

   <summary>🇨🇳 用正确的方式度个假</summary>

你计划一个假期来放松，恢复活力，忘记所有的工作。但离开办公室通常意味着在前后要做一大堆额外的工作，所以你本该放松的时间实际上会加剧你的压力。如何避免这个问题?

在你的假期之前，多沟通和委派。把休假期间需要完成的任务按优先顺序列出来，并为每一项任务建立交接流程，与你休假期间接替你工作的人协调。然后提前通知任何可能受到影响的人你的假期，这样他们就都知道你要离开多久，在你离开的时候去找谁。

在你的假期中，设定一个目标:你是想放松，学习一种新的文化，还是想和朋友和家人联系?把这个目标当成你休假期间唯一的工作，允许自己从工作中解脱出来，这样你就可以专注于实现它。

最后，当你度假归来，用第一天的前 30 分钟列出优先事项清单，最好是在你打开收件箱之前。然后一次只做一件事。

记住:你值得拥有一个恢复元气的假期。你不应该承受额外的压力。
