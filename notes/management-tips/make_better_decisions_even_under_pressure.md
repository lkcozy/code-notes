## Tip

Learning to make good decisions, without hesitation and procrastination, is a skill that can set you apart from your peers. How can you stop vacillating on tricky choices, especially under pressure? Here are the steps to take when faced with making a tough call.

`Start by considering many different viewpoints`. This doesn’t mean you should seek out everyone’s opinion. Instead, identify the right people with the relevant expertise and give them a chance to clearly articulate their views.
Often, these will be colleagues who are closest to the action and implications of the decision in question.

`Make sure you’re focused on addressing the root cause of a problem` — not just the symptoms. If your decision doesn’t get to the heart of the matter, the problem is likely to repeat itself.

Also, `incorporate a consideration of both the short-term and long-term risks into your decision-making process`. It’s tempting to make a call based on what’s going to get you immediate results, but that rarely unlocks the most value.

学会做出正确的决定，而不是犹豫和拖延，这是一种能让你从同龄人中脱颖而出的技能。你如何能在棘手的选择上停止犹豫，尤其是在压力下？以下是在面临艰难抉择时应该采取的步骤。

首先考虑许多不同的观点。这并不意味着你要征求每个人的意见。相反，你应该找到具有相关专业知识的合适人选，并给他们一个机会清晰地表达自己的观点。通常，这些人将是最接近所讨论的决定的行动和影响的同事。

确保你关注的是解决问题的根本原因，而不仅仅是症状。如果你的决定没有触及问题的核心，问题很可能会再次出现。

同时，在决策过程中考虑短期和长期风险。根据什么能让你立即得到结果来打电话是很诱人的，但这很少能释放出最大的价值。
