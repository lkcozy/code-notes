## Tip

Collaborate is especially difficult right now, when some, or all, of your team is working remotely. But there are steps you can take to ensure your team is effectively moving ahead in accomplishing group goals.

1. You may be tempted to set aside a specific time to do this, but you don't want to add to people already overcrowded schedules. <Highlight>Use existing meetings to brainstorem, set vision, aligh roles, or have other creative and strategic discussions</Highlight>. Set an agenda in advance, and assign someone to facilitate the meeting to keep the group on track and focus on decision-marking.

2. Also, <Highlight>remember that not every communication needs to happen in a meeting</Highlight>. When you can, <Box>use shared documents<</Box>> that can be updated and tracked by multiple people asychronously, and set clear deadline for the team to review.

3. You can also <Highlight>encourage people to work virtually 'side by side' to push forward a shared project</Highlight>. They might get on a video call to work together, so that they can easily stop and ask a question or requested feedback.

Working together well from afar is difficulty, but it's possible, with intentionality and focus.

远程工作时也要有效协作


当你的团队中有些或全部成员都正在远程工作，协作就特别困难。不过，你也可以采取一些措施，以确保你的团队能够有效地完成团队目标。

1. 你可能希望为此预留一个特定的时间，但不希望将其加入已经过度拥挤的日程安排中。可以利用现有的会议来集思广益，设定远景，调整角色或进行其他创造性和战略性讨论。预先确定会议日程，并指派一名人员来协助会议，使团队保持在正轨上并专注于决策制定。

2. 与此同时，记住并非所有的沟通都需要在会议上进行。如果可以的话，使用可以由多人同步更新和跟踪的共享文档，并为团队设置明确的审阅时间。

3. 你还可以鼓励人们虚拟地'并肩作战'来推动共同的项目。通过视频通话，他们可以协同工作，这样他们就可以轻松的停下来，询问问题或者请求反馈。

远程合作很艰难，但是有目的性和专注度的时候是有可能实现的。
