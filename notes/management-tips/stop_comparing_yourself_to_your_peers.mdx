## Tip

One of the benefits of social media is that it allows us to stay connected to old friends and former colleagues. But sometimes seeing other people’s successes can make us feel competitive — or even like we’re falling behind.

There are a few strategies you can deploy to fight this uncomfortable feeling.

- First, track your triggers. Identify what drives you to compare yourself to others. For example, is there a specific friend or colleague whose accomplishments make you feel insecure?

- Next, reframe your thoughts. Instead of thinking of yourself as competing against that person, look at their accomplishments objectively. What can you learn from their progress?

- Then, counteract your self-doubt by doing something you're good at — it'll help you regain confidence and perhaps momentum toward your own goals.

- And finally, let go of the “shoulds.” They often lead to perpetual insecurity. Instead, consider the possibility that everything you have chosen to do until now has always been the right path, regardless of what you think you were supposed to do — or what others are doing.

别再拿自己和同龄人比了

社交媒体的一个好处就是它可以让我们与老朋友和前同事保持联系。但是，有时候看别人的成功，就会激发自己的竞争欲望，甚至会觉得自己落后了。我们可以用一些策略来对付这些消极情绪。

第一，追踪你的诱因。明确你为什么要把自己和别人做比较。例如，是否有同事或朋友的成就会让你感到不安？下一步，重新考虑你的想法。别把自己和那个人比做竞争对手，而是客观地看待他们的成就。从他们的进步中你可以学到什么？

然后，通过做一些自己擅长的事情来消除自我怀疑--这会帮你重获自信,或许还能帮你达成自己的目标。

最后，放过“应该”。它们常常会带来永久性的不安全感。取而代之的是，要考虑到这种可能性，那就是你所选择做的每件事都是正确的，不管你认为自己在做什么--或者别人在做什么。
