## Tip

I think there is a temptation to try to have opinions, especially the more senior you get.

Sometimes, that is valid. The experience you have built up means that you may have a hard-won lesson that you want to share to stop someone going down a similar treacherous path.

Sometimes, it is mere noise. It is noise for you, as it is often another discussion you now need to keep track of. It is also noise for the discussant, who now need to take that opinion into consideration. In already noisy environments like Slack, having less noise is often better.

Before sharing an opinion, I try to stop and reflect. `Will contributing my opinion meaningfully impact the outcome of the discussion? If it won’t then I can relish in the simple beauty of having no opinion.`

我认为有一种试图发表意见的诱惑，尤其是你的职位越高。

有时候，这是正确的。你积累的经验意味着你可能会有一个来之不易的教训，你想分享，以防止有人走上类似的危险之路。

有时，它仅仅是噪音。它对你来说是噪音，因为它通常是你现在需要跟踪的另一个讨论。对于讨论者来说，这也是一种噪音，他们现在需要考虑自己的观点。在像 Slack 这样嘈杂的环境中，噪音越小往往越好。

在分享观点之前，我会尝试停下来反省。`我的观点会不会对讨论结果产生有意义的影响？ 如果它不会，那么我可以享受没有意见的简单美。`
