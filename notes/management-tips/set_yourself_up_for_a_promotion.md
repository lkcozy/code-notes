## Tip

Itâ€™d be great if doing good work was enough to get you a promotion. But it usually takes more than that. To make the case that youâ€™re ready to move up, you also need to convince those making the decision, especially your manager. Hereâ€™s how.

- Keep a record of your wins. Track all of your achievements. Surpassed your goals? Cracked a big account? Make a note every time you accomplish something, and add it to a folder on your desktop or in your email. Include shoutouts from colleagues or clients.
- Plant the seed. Promotions donâ€™t happen overnight, and it could often take months to build your case. Initiate the first conversation (of many) with your manager either during your annual performance review or after youâ€™ve surpassed a major goal.
- Present a persuasive case. Explain to your manager how youâ€™ve grown, how your responsibilities have increased, and how your work has helped the company achieve its goals, using the data youâ€™ve tracked as evidence.

Making a case for your next promotion can be a tedious and trying journey. Preparing early for the conversation is the best way to boost your chances.
