## Tip

It’d be great if doing good work was enough to get you a promotion. But it usually takes more than that. To make the case that you’re ready to move up, you also need to convince those making the decision, especially your manager. Here’s how.

- Keep a record of your wins. Track all of your achievements. Surpassed your goals? Cracked a big account? Make a note every time you accomplish something, and add it to a folder on your desktop or in your email. Include shoutouts from colleagues or clients.
- Plant the seed. Promotions don’t happen overnight, and it could often take months to build your case. Initiate the first conversation (of many) with your manager either during your annual performance review or after you’ve surpassed a major goal.
- Present a persuasive case. Explain to your manager how you’ve grown, how your responsibilities have increased, and how your work has helped the company achieve its goals, using the data you’ve tracked as evidence.

Making a case for your next promotion can be a tedious and trying journey. Preparing early for the conversation is the best way to boost your chances.

如果工作做得好足以让你升职那就太好了。但通常需要更多的时间。为了证明你已经做好了升职的准备，你还需要说服那些做出决定的人，尤其是你的经理。以下是方法：

- 记录你的胜利。追踪你所有的成就。超越你的目标？开了一个大帐户？每次你完成一件事时都要做个笔记，并把它添加到你桌面上的文件夹或电子邮件中。包括同事或客户的喊话。
- 播种。升职不是一朝一夕就能发生的，而且往往需要几个月的时间来构建你的案例。在年度绩效评估期间或在完成主要目标后，与你的经理进行第一次谈话。
- 提出一个有说服力的案例。用你追踪的数据作为证据，向你的经理解释你是如何成长的，你的责任是如何增加的，你的工作是如何帮助公司实现目标的。

为你的下一次升职做准备可能是一段乏味而又艰难的旅程。提前为谈话做准备是增加机会的最好方法。
