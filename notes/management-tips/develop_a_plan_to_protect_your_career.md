## Tip

No matter what stage you are in your career, it’s important to plan for your future. And while it’s more fun to plan for your upcoming success, it's also important to identify potential risks that could threaten your vision.

Start by writing down your assumptions about your professional life. Which factors do you take for granted? These could be as simple as the city in which you live or the industry in which you work.

Then ask yourself what you would do if these factors suddenly changed. What if your company folded, your industry collapsed, or you had to relocate to a new city on short notice? Emotions run high when catastrophe strikes, so defend against your vulnerabilities by devising a plan for the worst-case scenarios in advance.

Your career is a long-term investment; by proactively looking at the range of possible futures, you can avoid unnecessary risks, solve problems before they occur, and stay in control of your vision.

无论你处于职业生涯的哪个阶段，对未来做好计划都很重要。虽然为即将到来的成功做计划更有趣，但确定一些可能会威胁到你的前景的潜在风险也很重要。

首先写下你对职业生活的设想。你认为哪些因素是理所当然的? 这些可能就像你所生活的城市或者工作的行业一样简单。

然后扪心自问，如果这些因素突然改变，你该怎么办。假如你的公司倒闭了，你所在行业崩溃了，或者你在接到通知后很短时间内就搬迁到了一个新的城市，你会怎么作? 当灾难来袭时，情绪激动，所以要提前制定好应对不利情况的计划，以避免自己陷入困境。

职业生涯是一项长期投资; 通过积极地展望未来，你可以避免不必要的风险，在问题发生之前解决它们，从而控制你的前景。
