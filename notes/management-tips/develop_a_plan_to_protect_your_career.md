## Tip

No matter what stage you are in your career, itâ€™s important to plan for your future. And while itâ€™s more fun to plan for your upcoming success, it's also important to identify potential risks that could threaten your vision. Start by writing down your assumptions about your professional life. Which factors do you take for granted? These could be as simple as the city in which you live or the industry in which you work. Then ask yourself what you would do if these factors suddenly changed. What if your company folded, your industry collapsed, or you had to relocate to a new city on short notice? Emotions run high when catastrophe strikes, so defend against your vulnerabilities by devising a plan for the worst-case scenarios in advance. Your career is a long-term investment; by proactively looking at the range of possible futures, you can avoid unnecessary risks, solve problems before they occur, and stay in control of your vision.
