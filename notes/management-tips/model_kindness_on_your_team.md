## Tip

The benefits of kindness at work are well documented. But how do you actually promote caring and generosity on your team? First, take the lead. People are highly attuned to the behaviors of high-status team members; when you give compliments to your employees, they’re likely to emulate your behavior. Second, set aside time during Zoom meetings for a “kindness round,” in which team members are free to acknowledge and praise each other’s work. This doesn’t need to take up much time — even just a few minutes is plenty of time to boost morale and social connection. Finally, consider small, peer-nominated spot bonuses to allow people to recognize their colleagues’ work. If you have a limited budget, a gift card or a small gift can show appreciation that goes a long way. It’s your job as a leader to set a tone of kindness on your team. These small gestures can have a big impact.
