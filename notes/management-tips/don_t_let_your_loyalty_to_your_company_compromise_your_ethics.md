## Tip

Being dedicated to your organization is admirable. After all, loyalty has many benefits at work — it helps build trust, commitment, and a sense of team. But be careful that you aren’t so committed to your company that you compromise your ethics.You can guard against being blindly loyal by staying true to who you are.

First, `if you see something unethical, say something`. You may be concerned about “rocking the boat” at a place you care deeply about but remember that `silence often enables wrongdoing to continue, which is ultimately bad for the organization`.

`Don’t compete with your colleagues`. When workplaces get competitive, people start to lose sight of what is right and wrong. Instead, `seek out ways to collaborate and build loyalty across teams`.

Finally, `shift your perspective`. When you find yourself in a fraught situation where you are torn between what’s best for the organization and what’s best for you (say your manager is asking you to do something you feel is unethical, for example), try taking a step back and consider how someone who didn’t feel so loyal to the company would act in your shoes.

   <summary>🇨🇳 不要让你对公司的忠诚危及你的道德</summary>

致力于你的组织是令人钦佩的。毕竟，忠诚在工作中有很多好处——它有助于建立信任、承诺和团队意识。但是要注意的是，你不能对你的公司太投入，以致于牺牲了你的职业道德。你可以通过忠于你自己来防止盲目的忠诚。

首先，如果你看到一些不道德的事情，说出来。你可能会担心在你深切关注的地方“得不偿失”，但请记住，沉默往往会使不法行为继续下去，最终对组织不利。

不要和你的同事竞争。当职场变得竞争激烈时，人们开始忽视什么是对和错。取而代之的是，在团队之间寻找协作和建立忠诚的方法。

最后，改变你的观点。当你发现自己身处一个让你左右为难的境地，在对公司最好和对你最好之间左右为难时（比如，你的经理要求你做一些你认为不道德的事情），试着退后一步，想想那些对公司不那么忠诚的人会怎么做。
