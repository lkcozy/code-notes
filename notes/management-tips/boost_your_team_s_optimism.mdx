## Tip

These are trying times. But the job of a leader is to set a tone that empowers people to do their best work. So when the whole world is feeling down, how can you steer your team toward optimism? Here are four pieces of advice:

1. Make room for “organizational foolishness.” While careful planning and project management are important, you also need to create space to unleash your team’s imagination, creativity, and fun.
2. Invite everyone to become a problem-solver, then give them the autonomy to fix things and pursue new projects. Fostering a spirit of agency on your team will help them adopt a more optimistic mindset.
3. Strengthen personal relationships. Ultimately it’s human connections — with clients, patients, and colleagues — that keep employees upbeat and motivated.
4. Share and celebrate good news. There’s a lot of bad news right now, but as a leader you can put a spotlight on positive developments. Try distributing a newsletter that highlights what’s going well, or carving out some time for gratitude and positivity in your next team meeting.

现在是困难时期。但领导的工作就是定好基调，让员工把工作做好。因此，当全世界都感到沮丧时，你如何引导你的团队走向乐观?以下是四条建议:

1. 为“组织上的愚蠢”余留空间。虽然周密规划和项目管理非常重要，但你也需要创造空间来释放团队的想象力、创造力和乐趣。

2. 请每一个人都成为问题的解决者，然后自主解决问题并开展新项目。 培养团队中的代理精神会帮助他们采取更加乐观的心态。

3. 增进人际关系。归根结底，是人与人之间的关系，即与客户、病人和同事之间的关系，使员工保持乐观和动力。

4. 分享和庆祝好消息。目前坏消息很多，但作为一个领导者，你应该关注积极的发展。试着发布一份简报，强调那些进展顺利的事情，或者在下次小组会议上留一些时间来表达感激和积极的态度。
