## Tip

Crunch times — those long hours of work leading up to a product launch or deadline — are stressful, and often unavoidable. As a manager, how should you handle yourself during these high-pressure stretches so you and your team don’t burn out? Here are three strategies:

- `Set aggressive but achievable goals`. Think about something exciting but reachable based on the team’s level of performance and maturity. Evaluate the risks before assigning a goal. Learn from your team’s failures, and provide feedback to address their development gaps.
- `Recognize the costs of your decisions`. Sometimes leaders don’t know exactly what they’re asking of their teams during these crunch times. Pay attention and, to the extent possible, share the burden and partake in the team’s sacrifice.
- `Keep open lines of communication`. Crunch often affects a leader’s availability. Ensure that team members have a way to share key information with you, such as when they are being pushed too hard or things are not working as they should.

在产品发布或截止日期前的长时间工作是压力很大的，而且通常是不可避免的。作为一名管理者，你应该如何应对这种压力，以免你和你的团队精疲力竭?这里有三种策略。

- 设定积极但可达成的目标。根据团队的表现和成熟度，考虑一些令人兴奋但可以实现的事情。在分配目标之前评估风险。从你的团队的失败中学习，并提供反馈以解决他们的开发差距。
- 认识到你的决定的成本。有时候，领导者并不知道在危机时刻他们对团队的要求到底是什么。要注意，尽可能地分担团队的重担和牺牲。
- 保持通讯畅通。危机经常会影响领导者的可用性。确保团队成员有办法与你共享关键信息，例如，当他们被逼得太紧时，或者事情没有正常工作时。
