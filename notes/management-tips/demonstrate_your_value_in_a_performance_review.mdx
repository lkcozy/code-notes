## Tip

Performance reviews can be nerve wracking, but they’re important for ensuring your boss recognizes your value. Here are three tips for these anxiety-inducing conversations:
Highlight your achievements. Remind your boss of your accomplishments and how they’ve contributed to the outcomes your company cares about. You might say something like: “I know one of our team’s biggest priorities this quarter was to increase our social media following by 20%. The social media plan I developed is something I’m really proud of because it helped us achieve that goal.”
Demonstrate how you’ve helped your boss. Remind them of times you’ve built upon their ideas, helped them execute their goals, and brought your own ideas to the table that helped advance their cause.
Reemphasize your commitment to your organization. State your excitement about contributing to the future of the team and improving upon the work you’re already doing.
