## Tip

Being an "interim" or "acting" manager is often the fast track to getting the full-time job. To maximize your chances of being named the permanent replacement, you need to formulate a plan.

- Take some time to think about your vision and strategy.Then, decide where you want to concentrate your attention and energy. Are there operational issues that need tending to? Are there problems you can solve? Your goal is to demonstrate competence by achieving some classic early wins.

- Another way to distinguish yourself is by successfully managing key relationships. The way you interact with your employees — your former peers — is on display.

- Be open and transparent. Communicate regularly. Be collaborative, rather than directive.

- Don't get drawn into any workplace drama or office politics; stay as neutral as possible. And whatever you do, don’t overplay your authority.

   <summary>🇨🇳 做一个成功的临时经理 </summary>

成为“临时”或“代理”经理通常是获得全职工作的快速通道。 为了最大化你被任命为永久替代者的机会，你需要制定一个计划。

- 花点时间想想你的愿景和策略。然后，决定你想把注意力和精力集中在什么地方。是否存在需要注意的操作问题?有你能解决的问题吗?你的目标是通过取得一些经典的早期胜利来展示你的能力。

- 另一个让你脱颖而出的方法是成功地管理重要的人际关系。你与员工——你以前的同事——互动的方式被展示出来。

- 要公开透明。定期沟通。要合作，而不是指导性。

- 不要卷入任何办公室戏剧或办公室政治中;尽可能保持中立。不管你做什么，不要夸大你的权威。
