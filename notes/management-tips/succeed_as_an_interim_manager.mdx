## Tip

Being an "interim" or "acting" manager is often the fast track to getting the full-time job. To maximize your chances of being named the permanent replacement, you need to formulate a plan. Take some time to think about your vision and strategy. Then, decide where you want to concentrate your attention and energy. Are there operational issues that need tending to? Are there problems you can solve? Your goal is to demonstrate competence by achieving some classic early wins. Another way to distinguish yourself is by successfully managing key relationships. The way you interact with your employees â€” your former peers â€” is on display. Be open and transparent. Communicate regularly. Be collaborative, rather than directive. Don't get drawn into any workplace drama or office politics; stay as neutral as possible. And whatever you do, donâ€™t overplay your authority.
