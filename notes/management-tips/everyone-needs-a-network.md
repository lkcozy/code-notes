## Tip

If you pride yourself on being self-sufficient, you may have assumed that you don’t need a network. But even if you’ve achieved your current success on the strength of solo (or near-solo) efforts, making meaningful connections with people in your field can still be beneficial. If you don’t like the idea of networking, reframe it as a way of making interesting friends for the long term.

Create a “wishlist” of people you’d like to connect with — a senior colleague, a thought leader in your field, a respected author. You could connect with them by interviewing them for a blog or podcast.

Or, if you share a commonality like being part of an alumni group or professional association, you could simply suggest a “getting-to-know-you” call. If this feels like it’s not your speed, you might concentrate your networking efforts on one or two key conferences per year.

While it may feel uncomfortable at first, we all can stand to benefit from spending a little time getting to know people who may end up being our colleagues, mentors, or friends.

   <summary>🇨🇳 每个人都需要社交网络</summary>

如果你以自给自足为荣，你可能认为自己不需要社交网络。但是，即使你是通过独自(或接近独自)的努力取得了现在的成功，与你所在领域的人建立有意义的联系仍然是有益的。如果你不喜欢社交这个想法，那就把它重新定义为一种长期结交有趣朋友的方式。

列出你想要联系的人的“愿望清单”——资深同事，你所在领域的思想领袖，受人尊敬的作家。你可以通过在博客或播客上采访他们来与他们建立联系。

或者，如果你们有共同的爱好，比如成为校友团体或专业协会的一员，你可以简单地建议一个“结识”电话。如果感觉这不是你的速度，你可以把你的社交努力集中在每年一到两个关键会议上。

虽然一开始可能会感觉不舒服，但我们都可以从花一点时间去了解可能成为我们的同事、导师或朋友的人中受益。
