## Tip

Every leader has to face their predecessorâ€™s legacy. What should you do when you're replacing someone who was particularly inept, unlikeable, or controversial? Here are three strategies that can help you manage the transition â€” and help your team move on:

1. Acknowledge the contributions of the previous leader. Donâ€™t only highlight their shortcomings or blame them for all of the organizationâ€™s current challenges.

2. Create space for reconciliation and establish a direction for the future. Most bad leadersâ€™ actions are, in part, rooted in good intentions. Openly acknowledging the gap between the previous leaderâ€™s vision and their results will create room for forgiveness and help you set a new course.

3. Seek to understand your employeesâ€™ experience. Some people may remain supportive of previous leadership, while others directly felt adverse effects. Ask your team what they want and need going forward â€” and do your best to oblige.

You donâ€™t automatically become a good leader merely by taking over for a bad one. Ultimately, you become a good leader by distinguishing yourself, being inclusive, and having an eye toward the future.
