## Tip

Every leader has to face their predecessor’s legacy. What should you do when you're replacing someone who was particularly inept, unlikeable, or controversial? Here are three strategies that can help you manage the transition — and help your team move on:

1. **Acknowledge the contributions of the previous leader**. Don’t only highlight their shortcomings or blame them for all of the organization’s current challenges.

2. **Create space for reconciliation and establish a direction for the future**. Most bad leaders’ actions are, in part, rooted in good intentions. Openly acknowledging the gap between the previous leader’s vision and their results will create room for forgiveness and help you set a new course.

3. **Seek to understand your employees’ experience**. Some people may remain supportive of previous leadership, while others directly felt adverse effects. Ask your team what they want and need going forward — and do your best to oblige.

You don’t automatically become a good leader `merely by taking over` for a bad one. Ultimately, you become a good leader by distinguishing yourself, being inclusive, and having an eye toward the future.

   <summary>🇨🇳 接替一个糟糕领导的位置? 遵循这些步骤。</summary>

每一位领导人都必须面对前任的遗产。 当你换掉一个特别无能、讨厌或有争议的人时，你该怎么办? 以下三个策略可以帮助你管理转换，并帮助你的团队继续前进:

1. 感谢前任领导的贡献。不要只强调他们的缺点，或者把公司当前面临的挑战都归咎于他们。
2. 为和解创造空间，为未来确立方向。在某种程度上，大多数糟糕领导人的行为都源于良好的意图。公开承认前任领导的愿景和他们的结果之间的差距，将创造宽恕的空间，并帮助你设定新的路线。
3. 试着去理解你的员工的经历。一些人可能会继续支持前任领导，而另一些人则直接感受到负面影响。问你的团队他们想要什么，需要什么，然后尽你所能去满足他们。

你不会仅仅通过接管一个坏领导就自动成为一个好领导。最终，你会成为一名优秀的领导者，因为你让自己与众不同，具有包容性，并且着眼于未来。
