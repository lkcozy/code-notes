## Tip

Leading an organizational transformation is hard. If you’ve got a major change on the horizon (or if you're currently leading one that's stuck in a ditch), you need to be aware of three common pitfalls — and how to avoid them.

1. Don't underestimate the scope of the work. Executing a transformation at scale typically requires more time and coordination than leaders expect. To counter this, make sure you have realistic expectations. Take an incremental approach to the overall goal by launching a series of small-scale projects and initiatives led by distinct teams. And be sure that all of these related initiatives — and the people who lead them — are aligned, communicate effectively, and avoid taking on overlapping or conflicting work.

2. Don’t overestimate your employees' capacity to execute your vision while continuing to carry out their existing day-to-day responsibilities. Listen for feedback about their ability to deliver. Be ready to adapt accordingly.

3. Don’t hide why this transformation is important to you. Be transparent and express why you believe the organization should move in this new direction. You want to be a leader who inspires trust throughout the transition.

   <summary>🇨🇳 领导组织变革时避免这3个陷阱</summary>

领导组织变革是困难的。如果你即将发生重大的变化(或者你正在引领一个陷入困境的变革)，你需要注意三个常见的陷阱——以及如何避免它们。

1. 不要低估工作的规模。大范围实施转变通常需要比领导者预期更多的时间和协调。要解决这个问题，请确保你有确实可行的期望。在不同团队领导下，通过开展一系列小规模的项目和计划，逐步实现整体目标。确保所有这些相关的计划，以及领导这些计划的人员，保持一致，有效的沟通，避免承担重叠或冲突的工作。

2. 不要高估员工在履行现有日常职责时执行愿景的能力。听取他们交付能力的反馈。做好相应调整的准备。

3. 不要掩饰这种转变对你的重要性。并且表达出你认为组织应该朝着这个新方向发展的理由。 在整个过渡时期，你要做一个能激发信任的领导者。
