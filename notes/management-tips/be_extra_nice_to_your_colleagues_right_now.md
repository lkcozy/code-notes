## Tip

When you're under constant stress, it's not always easy to be patient and understanding with your coworkers. But being judgmental doesn't help anyone. How can you find — and demonstrate — empathy for your colleagues when you’re emotionally depleted? First, accept that we’re all coping with the coronavirus crisis differently. For example, you may find it helpful to pay close attention to the news, for example, while a colleague prefers to limit the amount of information they take in. Also, be generous in your interpretations of others when they send a terse email or look grumpy on a video call. It’s more than likely that their mood has nothing to do with you or work. Do your part by being honest about what you’re feeling at the moment and clearly communicating your needs. And remember that your coworkers are likely suffering in ways that you don't see or necessarily understand. Don't try to compare suffering. Instead, lean into compassion, empathy, and kindness.
