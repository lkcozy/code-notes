## Tip

When you're under constant stress, it's not always easy to be patient and understanding with your coworkers. But being judgmental doesn't help anyone.

How can you find — and demonstrate — empathy for your colleagues when you’re emotionally depleted?

First, `accept that we’re all coping with the coronavirus crisis differently`. For example, you may find it helpful to pay close attention to the news, for example, while a colleague prefers to limit the amount of information they take in.

Also, `be generous in your interpretations of others` when they send a terse email or look grumpy on a video call. It’s more than likely that their mood has nothing to do with you or work. Do your part by being honest about what you’re feeling at the moment and clearly communicating your needs.

And remember that `your coworkers are likely suffering in ways that you don't see or necessarily understand`. Don't try to compare suffering. Instead, lean into compassion, empathy, and kindness.

   <summary>🇨🇳 马上对你的同事好一点</summary>

在持续的压力之下时，你很难对同事保有耐心，也很难理解他们。但评头论足对任何人都没有帮助。怎样才能在心情低落的时发现和展现出对同事的同情呢？

首先，承认事实，我们正在以不同的方式应对冠状病毒危机。比如，你可能会发现密切关注新闻很有帮助，而一个同事喜欢限制他们所接收的信息的数量。

另外，当别人发了一封简短的电子邮件，或者在视频电话里发脾气时，你要善意地理解他们。其情绪可能与你或工作毫无关系。做你该做的，诚实地表达你此刻的感受，清楚地表达你的需求。

记住，你的同事很可能正遭受着你看不见也不理解的痛苦。别试图比较痛苦。相反，要学会怜悯、同情和善良。
