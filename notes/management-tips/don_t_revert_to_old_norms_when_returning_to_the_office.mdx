## Tip

If you work in a place where pandemic restrictions are easing up, and you’re headed back to the office, it may be tempting to get back to “business as usual.”

But this is the `perfect opportunity to reflect on how you want your team to operate differently going forward`. Which new practices do you want to keep? Which ones do you want to let go?

- `Start by identifying which new practices were successful, why they were successful, and under which circumstances they’ll continue to be useful`. You can do this by surveying your employees to understand what they did differently during the crisis and then conduct follow-up discussions about what worked for them and what didn’t.

- `Next, help your team unlearn outdated practices`. Maybe in-person meetings are no longer important to your organization, or the traditional 9-to-5 workday doesn’t need to be the team-wide standard.

- `Communicate clearly that your expectations as a manager have changed.` Most people will instinctively revert to old routines so, finally, reinforce the new practices and procedures until they turn into habits.

   <summary>🇨🇳 返回办公室时不要恢复旧规范</summary>

假如你正在一个大流行病限制正在放松的地方工作，而你又要回到办公室，那么你很可能会回到“正常工作”的状态。

但是这是一个绝佳的机会，让你重新思考你希望你的团队如何以不同的方式工作。你希望保留哪些新的实践? 你想放弃哪一个?

首先确定哪些新实践是成功的，为什么它们会成功，以及它们在何种情况下仍然有用。通过调查员工，你可以了解他们在危机中采取了哪些不同的做法，然后进行后续讨论，看看哪些做法对他们有用，哪些没有。

其次，帮助你的团队忘掉过时的实践。也许面对面的会议对公司来说不再重要，或者传统的朝九晚五的工作时间不必成为整个团队的标准。

清楚地传达你作为管理者的期望已经改变了。大部分人都会本能地回到旧常规中，因此，最后，要加强新的实践和做法，直到它们变成习惯。
