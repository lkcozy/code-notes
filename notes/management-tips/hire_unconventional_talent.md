## Tip

When it comes to hiring, too many managers unconsciously hold onto the notion that there’s one ideal candidate type for a role. But if you want to build a diverse team, you need to be open to a range of possible candidates. To make your hiring process more inclusive, especially of applicants who may have nontraditional backgrounds, adopt these strategies.

- Help unconventional candidates envision themselves at your company. When you’re writing a job description or interviewing a candidate, paint the big picture of a role rather than a checklist of specialized skills, degrees, or years of experience.
- Focus on potential rather than pedigree. When interviewing, ask questions that help you understand not just what they’ve done but what they’re capable of. For example, an open-ended question like “What were you doing the last time you looked at a clock and realized you had lost all track of time?” can help you uncover intellectual curiosity and understand what motivates someone.
- Don’t obsess over job titles. Rather than skimming resumes or LinkedIn profiles for a candidate’s education and experience, look at other non-professional experiences they may have, including volunteer or advocacy work, writing, or other interests. Those endeavors can often be more telling than a job title.
