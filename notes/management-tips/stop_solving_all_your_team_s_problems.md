## Tip

Your primary task as a leader is to build your team’s capabilities. The next time you’re tempted to solve a problem for a team member, `stop yourself and turn it into a learning opportunity instead`.

Set clear expectations, communicate what they’re accountable for, and give them the tools they need to succeed.

When someone comes to you with a problem, ask questions, such as: What do you think is at the core of this issue? Have you thought about alternative approaches? What can we sacrifice without detracting from the overall value of the project? Answering these questions can help your employee `unlock their creativity and dig deeper within themselves`, rather than relying on you to be the font of all wisdom. You’ll also learn something about `their capacity and capability, while giving them the opportunity to grow`.

Ultimately, your job is to `build a team that can function without you`. This is what will ultimately set you apart as a leader, not just a doer.

   <summary>🇨🇳 停止解决团队的所有问题 </summary>

作为领导者，你的首要任务是培养团队的能力。下次当你想为团队成员解决一个问题的时候，停下来，把它变成一个学习的机会。

设定明确的期望，沟通他们的责任，并为他们提供成功所需的工具。 当有人带着问题来找你时，问一些问题，比如：你认为这个问题的核心是什么？ 你考虑过其他方法吗？ 我们能牺牲什么而不减损项目的整体价值呢？ 回答这些问题可以帮助你的员工释放他们的创造力，更深入地挖掘自己，而不是依赖你成为所有智慧的源泉。你还可以了解他们的能力，同时给他们成长的机会。

最终，你的工作就是建立一个没有你的团队。 这最终会让你成为一个领导者，而不仅仅是一个实干家。
