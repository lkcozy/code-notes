## Tip

With the rise of remote work, we’re using email more than ever. So, it’s essential to take the time to make sure your words reflect what you actually want to say — and, crucially, how you want to say it. To do so, ask yourself these four questions before hitting send. First: Is my email too brief? We’re all moving quickly these days, but make sure you’ve shared any important details that the recipient should know. It’ll save both of you from having to clarify things down the road. Second: Are there any typos? Sloppy emails make it seem like you’re too busy to care, so take the time to proofread. Third: What tone am I projecting? It’s always hard to interpret an email that simply reads “Ok.” If you don’t have time for a thoughtful response in the moment, tell your recipient you’ll get back to them at a later date. And finally: Would it be helpful to talk instead? If you receive a vague or confusing email — or if the topic at hand is sensitive — a call might be the best way to resolve the issue. Giving your emails more careful attention will ensure you’re sending the right message.
