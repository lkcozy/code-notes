## Tip

The pandemic has followed us into 2021, and so has WFH burnout. As a manager, you need to be aware of how your team is really doing. So check in on your employees regularly. The simple act of communicating can relieve anxiety, but not everyone will let you know how they’re doing or what they need. So it’s incumbent on you to start these conversations and to make fair and appropriate accommodations. Be ready to offer flexible work hours whenever possible, and consider which tasks can be done asynchronously. This will give people the flexibility to manage multiple responsibilities (as many currently are). And encourage your team to schedule regular “away time,” when they’re not expected to be responsive online. These little tweaks will make a big difference as many of us continue to live in the middle ground between work and home.
