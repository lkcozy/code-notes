## Tip

Itâ€™s important to have a healthy awareness of your own limitations. But what should you do when your self-awareness starts to spiral into self-doubt? Here are four strategies to help you restore your confidence:
Channel an alter ego that can help you gain some perspective. Taking on the persona of someone more confident can help you acknowledge the challenges you face without letting them completely take you over.
View yourself through the lens of others. How would a friend respond if they heard you being hard on yourself?
Learn to recognize and ignore unhelpful, uninformed feedback. Recognize that not every opinion is useful.
Reframe negative self-talk. Identify your internal voices and intentionally replace them with a more positive, productive narrative.
