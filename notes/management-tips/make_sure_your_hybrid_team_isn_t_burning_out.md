## Tip

Hybrid work is presenting teams — and managers — with a major problem: The dissolution of work-life balance. As a boss, how can you help your team mitigate the downsides of hybrid, asynchronous work? Here are a few strategies to consider.

- Rethink daily schedules. Build in breaks between meetings, or during extended ones, so employees have a chance to grab a glass of water, get ready for their next call, or mentally transition to a new topic. This practice will reduce multitasking and the stress that accumulates when everyone is putting in long, packed days.
- Carve out time for focused work. Encourage people to set aside blocks of time each week to engage in projects without distractions or interruptions. More time to focus means more progress, which means less stress. It also decreases the likelihood that work spills into after hours.
- Encourage time off. It’s essential that everyone unplug, whether they’re taking vacation, staycation, mental health days, sick days, or observing religious holidays. Help your team understand that there are many ways to rest and recharge that don’t hinge on travel or trips and that their well-being is a priority.

混合工作给团队和管理者带来了一个大问题：工作与生活的平衡被打破。 作为老板，您如何帮助您的团队减轻混合、异步工作的缺点？ 下面是一些需要考虑的策略

- 重新考虑每日时间表。 在会议间隙或延长会议时间内建立间歇时间，这样员工就有机会喝杯水，为下一次通话做好准备，或在精神上转移到新的话题上。 这种做法将减少多任务和压力积累时，每个人都投入了漫长，拥挤的日子。
- 为重点工作腾出时间。 鼓励人们每周留出一段时间，不受干扰或干扰地投入到项目中。 更多的时间集中精力意味着更多的进步，这意味着更少的压力。 这也降低了下班后工作的可能性。
- 鼓励休假。 不管是度假、度假、心理健康日、病假，还是宗教节日，每个人都要保持冷静是很重要的。 帮助你的团队明白有很多方法可以让他们休息和充电，而这些方法并不依赖于旅行或者旅行，他们的健康是最重要的。
