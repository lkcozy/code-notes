## Fundamental Attribution Error

> We cut ourselves a break, but hold others accountable.

Humans tend to:

(1) Attribute someone else's actions to their character‚Äîand not to their situation or context.

(2) Attribute our actions to our situation and context‚Äîand not to our character.

## Humans generally think very highly of themselves

> We tend to believe that we see the world with perfect objectivity.

We also assume that people who disagree with us must be ignorant, uninformed, or biased.

This error sits at the core of many societal problems.

## The Curse of Knowledge

Experts‚Äîor generally intelligent people‚Äîmake the flawed assumption `that others have the same background and knowledge on a topic as they do`.

It makes them unable to teach or lead in an effective manner for those still coming up the learning curve.

## Groupthink

An all-too-common psychological phenomenon in which `people strive for consensus and conformity within a group`.

People set aside their own beliefs or principles to adopt those of the group and appease the whole.

Opposition is silent and decision-making falters.

## Confirmation Bias

## Survivorship Bias

History is written by the victors.

Studying and learning from "survivors‚Äù‚Äîwhile systematically ignoring "casualties‚Äù‚Äîcreates material distortions in our conclusions.

We overestimate the odds of success because we only read about successes.
