## [Advanced Solution](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/advanced-cfop-fridrich/)

When talking about the advanced technique of solving the Rubik's Cube we have to mention the Petrus system and the Fridrich method (or full CFOP) which is used by the big majority of speedcubers these days. This advanced technique developed by Jessica Fridrich divides the puzzle into layers and you have to solve the cube layer by layer using algorithms in each step, not messing up the pieces already in place. These steps are the following: Cross, F2L, OLL and PLL, as seen on the illustration above.

The method developed by Jessica Fridrich involves memorizing a lot of algorithms, but there is a logical connection between them. After a lot of practice you will develop the ability to execute these operations intuitively.
