## Tip

Unrealistic deadlines don’t help anyone — and yet more often than not, employees avoid asking for extensions even when they know more time would help them do a better job. It’s understandable. They likely don’t want to be seen as incompetent, and research has shown that we often falsely assume that the timeliness of a deliverable is more important than its quality. Given these factors, it's important to explicitly and proactively communicate with your team whether certain deadlines can be adjusted.

Instead of expecting your team to guess whether it’s OK to ask for more time, clarify when employees will be judged on the speed of their work, and when the quality is more important. This will help your employees worry less about how they’ll be perceived if they request a deadline extension, in turn reducing their stress and boosting the quality of their work.

And when timeliness is the priority, make that clear ahead of time so your team knows the deadline isn’t flexible — and why.

不切实际的最后期限并不能帮助任何人——然而，员工往往避免要求延期，即使他们知道更多的时间可以帮助他们做得更好。 这是可以理解的。 他们可能不想被认为是无能的，研究表明，我们经常错误地认为交付物的及时性比质量更重要。

与其指望你的团队去猜测是否可以要求更多的时间，不如弄清楚什么时候员工会被以工作的速度来评判，什么时候质量更重要。 这将帮助你的员工减少担心如果他们要求延长最后期限，他们会被如何看待，从而减轻他们的压力，提高他们的工作质量。

当时间性是首要任务的时候，提前把它弄清楚，这样你的团队就会知道最后期限是不灵活的——以及为什么
