## Tip

Have you ever wondered whether it’d be helpful to work with a career coach? Hiring one requires time and money, so it’s important to do your due diligence before making the investment. Here are five reasons you might consider hiring one.

- `You don’t know what you want to do next`. If you’re not sure what will bring you fulfillment, a coach can help you consider possibilities that are a departure from your past experiences or that you hadn’t considered.
- `You want to drastically improve your resume and LinkedIn profile`. Maybe you need support in identifying transferable skills that are relevant to a role you’re interested in, even if they don’t match up exactly with what’s in the job description.
- `You aren’t over your previous job`. Perhaps the way your last job ended has left you feeling wounded and lacking confidence. A career coach can encourage you to move past unpleasant career experiences and rebuild your belief in yourself.
- `You’ve been interviewing, but it's going nowhere`. A coach can help you refine your answers to other common interview questions, polish your executive presence, and practice with you so you feel confident in your next interview.
- `You’re not moving up in your career`. Coaches can decode performance feedback from your manager to uncover behaviors you need to adjust to continue to grow.

   <summary>🇨🇳 雇佣职业教练是你的正确选择吗？</summary>

你有没有想过和职业教练一起工作是否有帮助？雇佣一个需要时间和金钱，所以在进行投资之前进行尽职调查是很重要的。这里有五个原因你可以考虑雇用一个。

- 你不知道你下一步想做什么。 如果你不确定什么会带给你成就感，教练可以帮助你考虑那些与你过去经历不同或者你没有考虑到的可能性。
- 你想大大改进你的简历和 LinkedIn 档案。 也许你需要帮助来确定与你感兴趣的角色相关的可转移技能，即使这些技能与工作描述中的内容不完全匹配。
- 你还没有放下上一份工作。也许你上一份工作的结束让你感到受伤和缺乏信心。职业教练可以鼓励你摆脱过去不愉快的职业经历，重建你对自己的信心。
- 你在事业上没有进步。 教练可以从你的上司那里解读你的表现反馈，从而发现你需要调整的行为，以便继续成长。
