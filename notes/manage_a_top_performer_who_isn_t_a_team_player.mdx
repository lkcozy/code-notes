## Tip

Having a supremely talented and confident employee is a wonderful thing — except, of course, if that person is alienating their colleagues. How can you help this dominant personality improve their relationships?

For starters, you need to `provide some tough feedback`. Be honest about how they’re being perceived, and explain the consequences of their behavior. Say something like, “In order to live up to your talent, you need to consider how you might be standing in your own way.”

Next, `encourage them to develop more empathy and consider their colleagues’ perspectives and viewpoints`. You might say, “What matters to this person? What is their biggest concern? How can you find common ground with them?” Your objective is to foster their social and self-awareness.

But `don’t expect your efforts to yield immediate results`. Behavioral changes take time. Encourage your employee to be patient as well — with themselves and others.

拥有一名才华横溢、自信满满的员工是一件很好的事情——当然，除非这个人正在疏远他们的同事。你如何帮助这种占主导地位的个性改善他们的关系？

首先，您需要提供一些严格的反馈。 诚实地告诉别人他们的感受，并解释他们行为的后果。你可以这样说：“为了不辜负你的才能，你需要考虑你可能会如何阻碍你自己。”

其次，鼓励他们发展更多的同理心，考虑同事的观点和看法。 你可能会说，“什么对这个人重要？他们最大的担忧是什么？ 你如何才能与他们找到共同点？ 你的目标是培养他们的社交和自我意识。

但是不要期望你的努力会产生立竿见影的效果。行为的改变需要时间。鼓励你的员工对自己和他人也要有耐心。
