Web scraping refers to extracting and harvesting data from websites via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) in an automated fashion by using a script or program considered a web scraper.

A web scraper is a software application capable of accessing resources on the internet and extracting required information. Often, web scrapers can structure and organize the collected data and store it locally for future use.

Some standard web scraping tools include:

- Scrapy
- HTTrack
