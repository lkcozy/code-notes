## Human computing interaction (HCI)

human cognition-> computer processing

- intuitive or complicated?
- rewarding or frustrating
- user-friendly

- cartography
  - abstraction: present real world effectively. There are three types of mechanism that may be used in cartographic abstraction
    - simplification: providing only a limited amount of detail about the world
    - classification: providing information only on certain types of Features
    - symbolization: using coherent graphical symbols to represent features
      - six variables
        - position
        - shape
        - size
        - colour
        - orientation
        - patter
- geovisualization
  - humans use two fundamental different types of though process:
    - verbal thinking
    - visual thinking

## Interface design

- GIS Tasks(increased need to engage in geographic thinking)
  - presentation
  - querying (goal-driven retrieval)
  - browsing (relationship-driven retrieval)
  - editing (changes or corrections)
  - integration (combining or conflating)
  - analysis (process to reveal hidden relationship)
  - decision making (evaluating and choosing between different courses of action)
  - problem solving (designing solutions for new problems and unfamiliar domains)
