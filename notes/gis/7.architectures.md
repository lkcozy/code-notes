## Hybrid, integrated and composable architectures

- `architecture`: the overall `structure` and organization of the different parts of the information system
- `modularity`: the `extent` to which an information system can be constructed from independent software units with standardized or clearly defined functions
- `interoperability`: the `ability` of two or more information systems to `share data, information, or processing capabilities`
- hybrid gis architecture: store geospatial and non-geospatial separately
  - spatial data stored in `a set of system files`
  - non spatial data stored in a database
  - records in the spatial files are `linked` to tuples in the non spatial database `using a set of common keys`
  - pros: modular
  - cons: need to maintain integrity, security, and reliability more difficult
- Integrated architecture: store all data in a single databases
  - object-oriented databases

## Syntactic and sematic heterogeneity

- `exchanging, sharing and integrating data` is fundamental for any GIS architecture
- barriers to data sharing
  - syntactic heterogeneity: systems use incompatible encoding of formats for information
    - data must be converted into compatible formats
  - semantic heterogeneity: systems use different of incompatible meanings
    - difficult to reconcile
- transfer formats address syntactic heterogeneity by providing a standard intermediate format for data conversion
- data dictionary can address semantic heterogeneity
  - spatial data transfer standard
- Spatial data infrastructures(SDI): strategies for sharing and coordinating geospatial data

## Distributed Systems

- a collection of multiple information system connected via a digital communication network that synchronously co-operate to complete a computing task
  - mainframe network
  - `Peer to peer network`
- protocol is standard format for communication
  - HTTP
  - MQTT: lightweight publish-subscribe protocol for machine-to-machine in low bandwidth environments

## Distributed databases

- pros
  - decentralization
  - availability and reliability
  - performance
  - modularity
- cons
  - complexity
  - security
  - integrity
- relational distributed databases
  - fragmentation
  - replication

## location-aware Computing

- context aware computing: the use of sensors and other sources of information about a user's context to provide more relevant information and services
- location-aware computing: utilize information about a user's current location to provide more relevant information and services to that user
- pervasive computing
- mobile computing
- `active`: rely on signal transmitted from beacons
  - `proximity (cell phones)` determine location by identifying nearest beacon
  - `triangulation (GPS)` determine location using geometry of beacons
    - radio wave signals transmit exact time and that satellite's position
    - distance is determined by time it takes the signal to reach receiver
- `passive`: do not rely on signals transmitted from beacons
  - `motion tracing(speed and direction sensors)` track movement over time determine displacement
  - `scene analysis (digital camera)` analyze images from digital camera
- sensor accuracy and precision
  - accuracy: the `closeness` of data from a sensor to the correct value(s)
  - precision: `the level of detail` of the data generated by a sensor
- Location-based services(LBS): integrate and process information from a variety of sources: db, sensors, mobile
  - position
  - tracking
  - mobile resource allocation

How do we protect an individual's privacy when using location-aware services (blockchain)
