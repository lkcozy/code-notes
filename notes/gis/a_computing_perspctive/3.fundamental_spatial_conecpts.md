- What is space?

> In the context of GIS, we normally use the term `space` to refer to `geographic space`: the `structure` and `properties` of the `relationship between locations` at the Earth's surface.

- `geometry`: `measurement of the Earth`, provides a formal `representation` of the `abstract properties and structures` within a space
- `invariance`: a group of transformations of space under which propositions remain true

- primitive space: collections of objects with no other structure

## Euclidean space: coordinatized model of space

- enables measurements of distances and bearings between points
- `transforms spatial properties into properties of tuples of real numbers.`
- coordinate frame consists of a fixed origin and a pair of orthogonal lines (axes) intersecting in the origin
- point
- line
- polygon
  - monotone chain
  - monotone polygon
  - triangulation
- transformations
  - preserve particular properties of embedded objects
  - translations
  - rotation
  - reflection
- topological invariants: properties that are preserved by topological transformations

## Set-based geometry of space

- `elements`: the constituent objects to be modeled
- `sets`: collection of elements
- `membership`: the relationship between the elements and the sets to which they belong

## Topology of space:study of form

- branch of geometry
- concerns properties that are `invariant` under topological transformations
  - topological
    - an arc is simple
    - an area is connected
  - Non-topological
    - distance between two points
    - length of an arc
- neighborhood: one way of defining a topological space
- `topology`: the study of topological transformation and properties that are left invariant by them

## Network spaces

- to represent a system of roads or rail
- graph: a set of unordered paris of distinct nodes
  - highly abstract
- directed graph
- labeled graph

## Metric spaces

- metric: a generalization of the Euclidean metric
- distance function
  - Geodestic distance: e.g., the distance along the great circle of the Earth passing through the two city centers
  - Manhattan distance: the sum of the difference latitudes and longitudes.
  - Travel time distance: the minimum time required to travel from one city to the other
- properties
  - sensible distances cannot be allowed to be negative
  - distance is symmetric, a->b = b->a
  - triangle inequality

## Fractal geometry

- scale dependence: `appearance and characteristics` of many geographic and natural phenomena depend on `the scale at which they are observed`
- straight line adn smooth curves are not well suited to modeling `self-similarity` and scale dependence (`why`)
- fractals: self-similar across all scales, fundamentally different types of geometry
  - defined recursively, rather than by describing their shape directly
  - dimensions: an indicator of shape complexity,
