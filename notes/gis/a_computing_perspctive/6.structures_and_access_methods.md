Describe the organization of data in computer `storage` to facilitate `efficient retrieval`.

## Highlights

- physical file organization affects database performance
- `indexes` are needed to go beyond the limitations of physical file organization
- non-spatial indexes, like B-trees, are inadequate for storing spatial data
- the key issue in spatial indexes is `representing two dimensional data in a one-dimensional index`

## General structure and access methods

- physical data management
  - block: the atomic unit of data on a disk
  - unordered files
    - insertion is very efficient
    - linear search with time complexity O(n)
  - ordered files
    - slows the insertion of new records
    - support efficient binary search with time complexity of O(logn) on indexed field
- index: is an auxiliary structure specifically designed to speed retrieval of records
  - trade space for speed
  - the concept of an index to a file is similar to the index to a book
  - Spatial index is a special data structure for points and rectangles that allows you to perform queries like `all items within this bounding box` very efficiently (e.g. hundreds of times faster than looping over all items).
  - B-Trees: a self-balancing search tree
    - `balanced = equal length` through modification
    - all leaves are at the same level
    - time complexity O(logn)

## From one to two dimensions

- spatial Queries
  - point query:retrieve all records with spatial references located at a particular point
  - range query: retrieve all records ith spatial references located within a given range (spatial ranges may be any shape, but are often rectangular)
- the main problem facing multidimensional spatial data structures is that `data storage is essentially one-dimensional`
- tile indexes: grid-based representation, convert multidimensional to 1-dimensional
  - row
  - row-prime
  - morton: z

## Raster structures

- rasters provide a fixed grid for storing data
- cells are addressed using the row and column number
- store as arrays
  - easy to compute
  - waste space
- Quadtree: is a tree structure where every non-leaf node has `exactly four descendants`
- Region quadtree recursively `subdivide non-homogeneous square` arrays of cells into four equal sized `quadrants`
- decomposition continues until all squares bound homogenous regions
- pros: take full advantage of the spatial structure adapt to variable spatial detail
- cons: inefficient for highly inhomogeneous rasters
- very sensitive to changes in the embedding space (e.g., translation rotation)

## Point object structure

- grid structures: partition of planar region into equal sized cells- without accounting for point distribution
  - improve range query
  - partition size depends on
    - number of points
    - magnitude of average range query
  - poor performance with non-uniform point distribution
- Point quadtree:combination of grid approach with multidimensional binary search tree
  - lead to exponential increases in descendants in k dimensions
- 2D tree
  - trade tree breadth for depth
  - structure depends on order of point insertion

## Collection of objects

- efficient indexes for rectangles are important because rectangles can be used to approximate bounded planar spatial objects.
- each geometric object is enclosed in its MBB
- minimum bounding box (MBB): the smallest rectangle bounding a shape with its axes parallel to the sides
- using MBB, some queries may be answered without retrieving the geometry of an object
- e.g., find all objects which lie entirely within a specified region

- R-Tree: multidimensional dynamic spatial data structure similar to the B-tree
  - leaf nodes represent actual rectangles to be indexed
  - rectangles at any level may overlap
  - good subdivisions
    - minimize the total area of containing rectangles
    - minimize the total area of `overlap` of containing rectangles
  - overlap is critical-> point and range searches

## Spherical data structures

- spherical tessellations provide closer approximation to surface of the Earth
- Quaternary triangular mesh(QTM) approximates the surface of the globe
