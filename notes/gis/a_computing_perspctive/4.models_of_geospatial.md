## Models and ontology

> particular classification vs general taxonomies

- Ontology: the study of general classification of, and relationships between, those things that exist in the world.
  - aims to develop `general taxonomies` of what exists
- modeling: the process of representing `the source domain` in the `target domain`
  - aims to `develop classifications` within a `particular` application domain
  - purpose is to `simplify and abstract` away from source domain
  - the distinction between substance and property is not a data modeling issue
  - the decision to represent a road in a navigation system as a polyline or as an area is a data modeling question
  - insight, results and computations in the target domain may then be interpreted in the source domain
  - usefulness is determined by how closely the model can simulate the source domain, and how easy it is to move between the two domains.

## The modeling process

Type of models

- Field-based model: treats geographic information as collections of `spatial distributions`
  - distribution may be formalized as a mathematical function from a spatial framework to an attribute domain
  - `patterns` of topographic altitudes, rainfall, and `temperature` fit neatly into this view.
- Object-based model: treats the space as populated by `discrete, identifiable entities` each with a geospatial reference
  - buildings or roads
  - geospatial relationships
- The field-based and object-based approaches are attempts to impose structure and pattern on such data
  - field-based: treats information as a collection of fields
    - each `field` defines the `spatial variation` of an `attribute` as a `function` from the set of locations to an attribute domain
  - object-based: clumps a relation as single or groups of tuples
- Field-based models

  - Spatial framework: `a partition of a region of space`, forming a finite tessellation of spatial objects.
    - polygons
    - must be a finite structure
    - however, the application domain will not be finite and `sampling is necessary`
    - `imprecision` is introduced by the sampling process
  - Layers: the `combination` of the `spatial framework` and the `field that assigns values` for each location
  - Spatial fields: z-coordinates, or heights
  - regular tessellation, square grid->raster-based data structures
  - irregular tessellation, triangulations->vector-based data structures
  - Properties of the attribute domain -> four levels of measurement(Stevens 1946)
    - `qualitative`
      - `nominal` attribute: simple labels, cannot be ordered
      - `ordinal` attribute: ordered labels,
    - `quantitative`
      - `interval` attributes: quantities on a scale without any fixed point, the ratio of two interval attributes values is not meaningful
      - `ratio` attributes: quantities on a scale with respect to a fixed point
  - continuous field: small changes in location leads to small changes in the corresponding attribute value
  - differential field: rate of change is defined everywhere
  - spatial framework and attribute domain must be continuous for both these types of fields
  - Isotropic fields: properties are independent of direction
  - anisotropic fields: properties are dependent on direction
  - Spatial autocorrelation is a `quantitative expression` of first law of geography

    - `everything is related to everything else`, but near things are more related than distant thing
    - measures the degree of clustering of values in a spatial field
    - positive
    - zero
    - negative

  - Operations on fields
    - map Algebra
    - local: one ore more spatial fields-> one new field

## Object-based models

- decompose an information space into `objects or entities`
- an entity must be
  - identifiable
  - relevant
  - describable
- spatial objects
  - inside space, embedding space
  - a set of primitive objects
  - point, line, polygon
- topological spatial operations-> spatial relationships
  - connected
  - is within
  - some affects the object
  - some don't alter

## Questions

- **What it is we are trying to model in GIS?**

> In GIS, models are needed to define the `relationship between our geographic environment` (the source domain) `and` the `representation of that environment within in a computer`(the target domain).
> `geographic environment<->model<->computer`

- **What is a model?**

> A model defines a `representation` of parts of one domain in another. e.g., `a flight simulator`

- **What is the purpose of the model?**

> To `simplify` and `abstract` away from the source domain.

- **What is the constituents of the domain?**

> Entities, relationships, processes, or any other phenomena of interest.

- **What is the modeling process?**

> initial study->system analysis->system design->system implementation->physical computational model->logical computational model->conceptual model->application domain model->application domain

- **How to evaluate a model's usefulness?**

> By how closely it can simulate the source domain, and how easy it is to move between the two domains.

- **What is the field-based model?**

> Treat space is made of a set of locations with properties (absolute space). `location->attributes`

![field-based model](images/field-based%20approach%20to%20geographic%20phenomena.png)

- **When to use the field-based model?**

> Analysis `continuously varying` geographic phenomena, like temperature or rainfall. regional climate variations, or regional health variations
> Conceptualize urbanization as a field based on the density of house (objects)

- **What is the object-based model?**

> Treat space is made of a set of objects with spatial properties (relative space). `attributes->location`

![object-based model](images/object-based%20approach%20to%20geographic%20phenomena.png)

- **When to use the object-based model?**

> Analysis `discrete` geographic phenomena, like buildings or roads.
> Conceptualize a zone of very low rainfall (field) as an object (a desert)

- **What is the difference between field- and object-based models?**

> The way to conceptualize the relationships between location and attributes.
> Field-based model uses a fixes spatial framework as a reference (such as regular grid) and then measures the variation in attribute values with respect to this reference.
> Object-based model populates the information space with spatially referenced entities with attributes

- **Why we need to learn basic ontological distinctions?**

> Because it can help us avoid some basic modeling mistakes.Typical modeling errors arising from a lack of ontological awareness. e.g., `failing to distinguish substances from their properties.`

- **What is the spatial framework?**

> It's `a partition of a region of space`, forming a finite tessellation of spatial objects.

- **What is the layer?**

> The combination of the `spatial framework` and the `field` that `assigns values for each location` in the framework.
