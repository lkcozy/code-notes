## What is spatial reasoning?

Is the `ability` to imagine, visualize and differentiate objects in two or three dimensions.

Make inferences about spatial aspects of the environment.

## Why is spatial information imperfect?

Uncertainty is unavoidable.

## What are the difference types of imperfection in spatial information?

- Inaccuracy: a lack of correlation between observations or representations and reality.
- Imprecision: it concerns a lack of specificity or a lack of detail in an observation or representation.
- Vagueness: it concerns the existence of borderline cases for a concept

## How can we reason about spatial information under uncertainty?

- Quantitative approach: an approach is based on analysis of numerical (interval ratio) data.
- Qualitative approach: an approach is based on analysis of classifications and ordering (nominal and ordinal data)

## What qualitative and quantitative approaches to uncertainty are there?

- quantitative
  - Probabilistic methods
  - Statistical methods
- Qualitative
  - Possible worlds
  - Belief and Knowledge
  - Belief revision
  - Fuzzy set theory

## What sorts of applications exist for reasoning under uncertainty?

- Uncertain regions
- Uncertain viewsheds
