Discusses the `representations` of spatial data for field- and object-based models, and some algorithms that are usd to `process data.`

## Computing with geospatial data

An algorithm is a specification of computational process required to perform some operation.

The efficiency of an algorithm is usually measured in terms of `the time` the algorithm `uses`, called `time complexity` or the `amount of storage space required`, called `space complexity`.

Use the `big-oh` notation to classify algorithms according to time complexity.

- O(1) very fast
- O(logn) Fast
- O(n) Moderate

## The discrete Euclidean plane

line simplification `reducing the level of detail` in the representation of a polyline, while still retaining its `essential geometric character`.

## The spatial object domain

- Spaghetti: represents a planar configuration of points, arcs, and areas. (a list of points)
  > A: [1,2,3,4]
- Node arc area (NAA)
- Doubly connected edge list (DCEL)

## Representations of field-based models

### Regular tessellated representations

- Tessellations: `a partition of the plane` as the union of a set of disjoint area objects or `the process of fitting shapes together in a pattern with no spaces in between`
- Regular polygon
  - Vertex figure
- `Regular` tessellation: participating polygons are regular and equal
  - `Square grid`: it is most commonly used regular tessellation
- `Irregular` tessellation: participating polygons are not all regular and equal
  - `Triangulated irregular tessellation(TIN)`: it is the most commonly used irregular tessellations
    - Delaunay triangulation
      - each circumcircle of a constituent triangle does not include any other triangulation point within it.
    - Proximal polygon
    - Voronoi diagram: A Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane.

### Fundamental geometric algorithms

- Distance and angle between points
- Area of a simple polygon
- Point in polygon
  - Semi-line algorithm: checks for odd or even numbers of intersections of a semi-line with polygon
  - Winding algorithm: sums bearings from point to polygon vertices
- Point of intersection
- Segment intersection

## Vectorization and rasterization

- Vectorization: converting data from raster to vector format

## Network representation and algorithms

- Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list(`a: (b,20),(c:15)`): good balance between `storage efficiency` and `computational efficiency`
- Depth first traversal: explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
  - In order: left->root->right
  - Pre order: root->left->right
  - Post order: left->right->root
- Breadth first traversal: begins at the root node and then visits all nodes level by level
- Shortest path
  - Dijikstraz
  - A\*
