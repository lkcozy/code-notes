[I3S(Indexed 3D Scene Layer)](https://github.com/Esri/i3s-spec) is an OGC Community Standard. I3S enables the storage and streaming of massive amounts of heterogeneously distributed geospatial content, in the form of millions of discrete 3D objects with attributes, integrated surface meshes and point cloud data covering vast geographic areas, to web browsers, mobile apps and desktop.
