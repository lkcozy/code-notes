This domain working group works to find best practices to better connect Space/Sky/Surface Sensor data interoperability.

- Observations & Measurements (O&M) - Standard models and XML Schema for encoding observations and measurements from a sensor, both archived and real-time.
- Sensor Model Language (SensorML) - Standard models and XML Schema for describing sensors systems and processes associated with sensor observations; provides information needed for discovery of sensors, location of sensor observations, processing of low-level sensor observations, and listing of taskable properties, as well as supports on-demand processing of sensor observations.
- Sensor Observations Service (SOS) - Standard web service interface for requesting, filtering, and retrieving observations and sensor system information. This is the intermediary between a client and an observation repository or near real-time sensor channel.
- Sensor Planning Service (SPS) - Standard web service interface for requesting user-driven acquisitions and observations. This is the intermediary between a client and a sensor collection management environment.
- SensorThings API (STA) - a RESTful web service based on JSON encoding that provides an open and unified way to interconnect Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data, and applications over the Web. This is the intermediary between a client (e.g., web application) and an observation repository or near real-time IoT sensor/actuator.
