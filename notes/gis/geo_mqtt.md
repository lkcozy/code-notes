A publish-subscribe protocol for the geospatial IoT.

- MQTT protocol only supports topic filter
- GeoMQTT protocol extends the MQTT protocol by adding the spatial filter and temporal filter, which partially moves filter processing from the client side to the server side.
- Besides the spatial and temporal filter, we could also add other customized properties (e.g., speed) as filter.
