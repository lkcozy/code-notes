## Models and ontology

- Ontology: the study of general classification of, and relationships between, those things that exist in the world.
  - aims to develop `general taxonomies` of what exists
- modeling: the process of representing `the source domain` in the `target domain`
  - aims to `develop classifications` within a particular application domain
  - purpose is to `simplify and abstract` away from source domain
  - the distinction between substance and property is not a data modeling issue
  - the decision to represent a road in a navigation system as a polyline or as an area is a data modeling question
  - insight, results and computations in the target domain may then be interpreted in the source domain
  - usefulness is determinded by how closely the model can simulate the source domain, and how easy it is to move between the two domains.

## The modeling process

Type of models

- Field-based model: treats geographic information as collections of `spatial distributions`
  - distribution may be formalized as a mathematical function from a spatial framework to an attribute domain
  - `patterns` of topographic altitudes, rainfall, and `temperature` fit neatly into this view.
- Object-based model: treats the space as populated by `discrete, identifiable entities` each with a geospatial reference
  - buildings or roads
  - geospatial relationships
- The field-based and object-based approaches are attempts to impose structure and pattern on such data
  - field-based: treats information as a collection of fields
    - each `field` defines the `spatial variation` of an `attribute` as a `function` from the set of locations to an attribute domain
  - object-based: clumps a relation as single or groups of tuples
- Field-based models

  - Spatial framework: `a partition of a region of space`, forming a finite tessellation of spatial objects.
    - polygons
    - must be a finite structure
    - however, the application domain will not be finite and `sampling is necessary`
    - `imprecision` is introduced by the sampling process
  - Layers: the `combination` of the `spatial framework` and the `field that assigns values` for each location
  - Spatial fields: z-coordinates, or heights
  - Properties of the attribute domain - four levels of measurement
    - qualitative
      - nominal attribute: simple labels, cannot be ordered
      - ordinal attribute: ordered labels,
    - quantitative
      - interval attributes
      - ratio attributes
  - continuous field: small changes in location leads to small changes in the corresponding attribute value
  - differential field: rate of change is defined everywhere
  - spatial framework and attribute domain must be continuous for both these types of fields
  - Isotropic fields: properties are independent of direction
  - anisotropic fields: properties are dependent on direction
  - Spatial autocorrelation is a `quantitative expression` of first law of geography
    - `everything is related to everything else`, but near things are more related than distant thing
    - measures the degree of clustering of values in a spatial field
    - positive
    - zero
    - negative
  - Operations on fields
    - map Algebra
    - local: one ore more spatial fields-> one new field

  ## Object-based models

  - decompose an information space into `objects or entities`
  - an entity must be
    - identifiable
    - relevant
    - describable
  - spatial objects
    - inside space, embedding space
    - a set of primitive objects
    - point, line, polygon
  - topological spatial operations-> spatial relationships
    - connected
    - is within
    - some affects the object
    - some don't alter
