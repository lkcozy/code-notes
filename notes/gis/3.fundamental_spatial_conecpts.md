- `geometry`: provides a formal `representation` of the abstract properties and structures within a space
- `invariance`: a group of transformations of space under which propositions remain true

## Euclidean space: coordinatized model of space

- transforms spatial properties into properties of tuples of real numbers.
- coordinate frame consists of a fixed origin and a pair of orthogonal lines (axes) intersecting in the origin
- point
- line
- polygon
  - monotone chain
  - monotone polygon
  - triangulation
- transformations
  - preserve particular properties of embedded objects
  - translations
  - rotation
  - reflection
- topological invariants: properties that are preserved by topological transformations

## Set-based geometry of space

- elements: the constituent objects to be modeled
- sets: collection of elements

## Topology of space

- study of form
- concerns properties that are `invariant` under topological transformations
  - topological
    - an arc is simple
    - an area is connected
  - Non-topological
    - distance between two points
    - length of an arc
- neighborhood: one way of defining a topological space

## Network spaces

- graph: a set of unordered paris of distinct nodes
  - highly abstract
- directed graph
- labeled graph

## Metric spaces

## Fractal geometry

- scale dependence: `appearance and characteristics` of many geographic and natural phenomena depend on `the scale at which they are observed`
- straight line adn smooth curves are not well suited to modeling self-similarity and scale dependence (`why`)
- fractals: self-similar across all scales
  - defined recursively, rather than by describing their shape directly
  - dimensions: an indicator of shape complexity,
