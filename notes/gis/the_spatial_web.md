## Abstract

- The Spatial Web will enable us to both build a twin of our physical reality in the virtual realm and bring the digital into our real environments.
- The power of the Spatial Web initially comes from its ability to describe the world in the language that the world speaks to us in `geometry`. It enables the current information on the web to be placed spatially and contextually on objects and at locations, where we can interact with information in the most natural and intuitive ways, by merely looking, speaking, gesturing, or even thinking.
- It also enables the digital to be more physical as sensors and robotics become embedded into our environments and onto the objects around us.

- It makes our world smarter as it adds intelligence and context to any place, any object, and every person that we encounter, and it allows our relationships with each other and this new network to be more trustworthy, more secure, and faster by decentralizing, and distributing the computing and storage of the data.
- The Spatial Web has the potential to move us from predominantly egocentric and ethnocentric concerns to more world-centric ones that are more holistic, equitable, and inclusive.

## The Spatial Web

- what is the spatial web?
  - world wide web: websites linked together
  - spatial web: people, places, and things linked together
  - 语义指的是理解单词以及句子想表达的真实的，内在的含义
  - 将独立的文本与前后文本联系起来，有关联，发散，举一反三的能力
- spatial web 3.0 stack
  - spatial (AR,VR,MR)
  - physical (IoT, wearables, robotics)
  - cognitive (ML, AL)
  - distributed (blockchain, edge computing)

What's the spatial web?
We call "spatial" because digital information will exist in space, integrated and inseparable from the physical world. It allows you interact with the rich, fun, meaningful, engaging and dynamic data directly

- physical layer
- digital information layer
- spatial interaction layer

Why we need the spatial web?

- Eliminate the boundary between digital content and physical objects, which vastly improve intuitive interactions and increase our ability to deliver highly contextualized experiences.

How it works?

How to realize this technology/vision?
Through AR/VR+5G+IoT+Blockchain+AI/ML
