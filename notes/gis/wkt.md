Geometry is a very complex data type: accordingly to this, OGC-SFS defines two alternative standard notations allowing to represent Geometry values:

- the **WKT** (Well Known Text) notation is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects.
- the **WKB** (Well Known Binary) notation on the other side is more intended for precise and accurate import/export/exchange of Geometries between different platforms.

| Type       | Examples                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Point      | POINT (30 10)                                 |
| LineString | LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40)              |
| Polygon    | POLYGON ((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10)) |
