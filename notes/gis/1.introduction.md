## What is GIS?

A computed-based information system that enables capture, modeling, storage, retrieval, sharing, manipulation, and presentation of `geospatial data`

- context: the structure of `interrelationships between data `and how data is collected, processed, used, and understood within an application
- data is only useful within its context
  `information = data + context`

## GIS functionality

- resource inventory
- network analysis
- distributed data
- terrain analysis
  - visibility Analysis
- layer-based analysis
- location analysis
- spatiotemporal information

## Data and databases

- data is measured in `bits`
- each bit records one of two possible states(0 or 1)
- `Bits` are merged into `bytes`
- each byte represents a single character
- each byte allows for 2^7=127 possible character combinations
- spatial data
  - raster: ara array of grid of cells
    - pros: easy to handle
    - cons: inefficient in storing
  - vector: a finite straight line segment defined by its end points
    - pros: efficient in storing
    - cons: hard to analysis
- Database: a repository of data, the process of `developing a database` is a process of `model building`
  - application domain model: describes the `core requirements` of users in a particular application domain
  - conceptual model: tailored to a particular type of implementation
  - physical computational model: the result of a process of programming and system implementation
- spatial data retrieval and Analysis
  - spatial data is notoriously large and often hierarchically
  - geospatial data is often embedded in the Euclidean plane-> `spatial storage structures` + `access methods`
  - Map-based presentation is a distinctive feature of a GIS
- Distributed database:multiple databases connected by a digital communication network.
  - Increased reliability
  - improved performance

## Hardware support

- input
- control
- storage
- processing
- digital networks: most communication networks are digital(0,1)
- analog network: for old data communication, signal strength can vary continuously like a sine wave
- Electromagnetic radiation
  - frequency
  - wavelength
  - `higher` bandwidth means `greater data transmission capacity`
  - High-frequency ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays are not used for data transmission
