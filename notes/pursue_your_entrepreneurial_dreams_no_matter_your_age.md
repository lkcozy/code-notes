## Tip

There's no "right" age at which to become an entrepreneur. Of course, having experience helps, but what matters more than age is your team, your idea, and your ability to advocate for yourself.

So, first, `assemble a team with a diverse set of skills`. This might include mentors, advisors, or people who have experience growing companies from the ground up. Include someone who knows how to manage people, as well as someone with the technological skills needed for development and operations, and so forth.

Next, `identify a problem you’re truly passionate about solving`. Find investors who are equally excited about addressing the pain points you care about, and convey your passion in a succinct, clear story to help rally others.

And finally, `be your own best advocate`. If you do encounter age bias, or other forms of discrimination, be prepared to address those concerns head on by demonstrating your competence, confidence, and care. 

With the right idea, attitude, and people behind you, you can turn your idea into a reality — at any point in your career.

   <summary>🇨🇳 追求你的创业梦想——无论你的年龄</summary>

成为一名企业家没有“正确的”年龄。当然，有经验是有帮助的，但比年龄更重要的是你的团队、你的想法和你为自己代言的能力。

所以，首先，组建一个拥有多种技能的团队。这可能包括导师，顾问，或者那些有从零开始发展公司经验的人。包括知道如何管理人员的人，以及具有开发和运营所需的技术技能的人，等等。

接下来，找出一个你真正热衷于解决的问题。 找那些同样热衷于解决你关心的痛点的投资者，用简洁明了的故事表达你的激情，帮助其他人团结起来。

最后，做自己最好的代言人。 如果你确实遇到了年龄偏见或其他形式的歧视，准备好通过展示你的能力、信心和关爱来正面解决这些问题。 

有了正确的想法、态度和支持你的人，你就可以把你的想法变成现实——在你职业生涯的任何阶段。
