## Step 1: Overview - establish a context

Before reading a book, first understand its overall framework, which is equivalent to getting a map. So you will know:

- What's here
- How are they distributed
- Which ones are 'scenic areas' (key points)

With these perceptions, you will most likely know the relationship between the book and yourself, and where you should focus.

You could find the map through reading (1)the catalog; (2) the preface or the introduction.

## Step 2: Create goals - design questions

What is the biggest challenges of reading? Inattention. Why can't you concentrate? Because the goal is not clear.

The solution is asking questions based on the title. There are three types of questions generally:

- What is it
- Why
- Wat should I do

## Step 3: Leave a mark - take note

Label two types of content:

- The key point: summary sentences,core knowledge points,etc.
- The golden sentences of the article: sentences that trigger thinking

## Step 4: Reorganize knowledge

Summarize highlights

## Step 5: Test results - answer questions

Answer questions you asked before reading

## Step 6: Extended thinking - link knowledge

After learning a chapter, make some associations, including the following five dimensions:

- Additional information: add contents not mentioned in the book
- Connect with good experiences in the past: that's what I did at that time. No wonder I succeeded.
- Connect with bad experiences in the past: No wonder it was bad. The problem is:
- Connect with future issues. If I have such a problem later, I can do it.
- Knowledge association: This is similar to the XX theory and the principle is similar

## Step 7: Strengthen memory - retell the story

Write a note includes:

- Introduction
- Methodologies
- Discussion
- Conclusion

Take notes, link other knowledge, and read it as your own knowledge, not just pure concepts and conversation.

`Reading is like a journey. The purpose is not to look around. It's about getting into it and finally finding a better self.`
