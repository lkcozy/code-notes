## Tip

Thoughtful deliberation is an essential leadership quality that can help you make better decisions and produce better outcomes. However, it can also devolve into overthinking, which can be paralyzing. Here are three ways to avoid a thought spiral that can slow you down:

1. `Curb your perfectionism`. Perfectionism is one of the biggest blockers to swift decision-making, because it operates on faulty all-or-nothing thinking. To curb this tendency, ask yourself questions like: What’s one thing I could do today to bring me closer to my goal? Or what’s the next step based on the information I have right now?
2. `Pay attention to your intuition`. When it comes to difficult decisions, your gut reaction is often an important data point, particularly when time is short or when you don’t have all the information you need. Research shows that pairing intuition with analytical thinking helps you make better, faster, and more accurate decisions and gives you more confidence in your choices than relying on intellect alone.
3. `Construct creative constraints`. Determine a date or time by which you’ll make a choice. Put it in your calendar, set a reminder on your phone, or even contact the person who’s waiting for your decision and let them know when they can expect to hear from you.

   <summary>🇨🇳 停止过度思考重大决定 </summary>

深思熟虑是一项重要的领导素质，可以帮助你做出更好的决定，产生更好的结果。然而，它也可能会发展成过度思考，从而导致停止不前。这里有三种方法可以避免让你慢下来的思想漩涡:

1. 控制你的完美主义。完美主义是快速做出决定的最大障碍之一，因为它运行在错误的全有或全无的想法上。为了抑制这种倾向，问自己这样的问题:今天我能做什么事来让我更接近我的目标?或者根据我现在掌握的信息下一步该做什么?
2. 注意你的直觉。当遇到困难的决定时，你的直觉反应通常是一个重要的数据点，特别是当时间很短或你没有所有需要的信息时。研究表明，与单纯依靠智力相比，将直觉与分析思维结合起来可以帮助你做出更好、更快、更准确的决定，让你在做出选择时更有信心。
3. 构建创造性的约束。确定你要做选择的日期或时间。把它写进你的日历里，在你的手机上设置一个提醒，甚至联系那个等待你决定的人，让他们知道他们什么时候会收到你的消息。
