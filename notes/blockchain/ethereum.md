Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another.

## [Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)

## [GAS and Fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)

Gas is essential to the Ethereum network. It is the fuel that allows it to operate, in the same way that a car needs gasoline to run.

## Tools
