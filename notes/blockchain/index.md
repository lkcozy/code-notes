## Basic

The basic concept of blockchain is quite simple: a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered time-stamped series of immutable records.

### Block structure

The first logical step is to decide the block structure. To keep things as simple as possible we include only the most necessary: index, timestamp, data, hash and previous hash.

## On-Chain Versus Off-Chain

While blockchain is fundamentally a storage solution, it principally differs from a database. A database is an organized collection of data representing the current system state. The main functionality of a database is to allow efficient data retrieval, fusion, and aggregation triggered by user queries. In contrast, most blockchain implementations represent a ledger in which a history of changes to the system state is recorded, which results in blockchain space being more expensive and the storage less efficient compared to a database.

As a result, only specific data elements (such as short transactions or indices) are stored on a blockchain. Most blockchain-based applications combine blockchain with offchain storage (databases or dedicated file systems)

### Advantages To Off-Chain Transactions Over On-Chain Transactions

â€¢ It's faster. The transactions are recorded instantly, without having to wait for the network confirmations.

â€¢ It's cheaper. Transactions done off-chain are usually free.

â€¢ It's more private. These transfers are not visible on the public blockchain.

### ðŸš€ [Build Blockchain Insurance Application](https://github.com/IBM/build-blockchain-insurance-app)

This project showcases the use of blockchain in insurance domain for claim processing. In this application, it has four participants, namely insurance, police, repair shop and the shop. Furthermore, each participant will own its own peer node. The insurance peer is the insurance company providing the insurance for the products and it is responsible for processing the claims. Police peer is responsible for verifying the theft claims. Repair shop peer is responsible for repairs of the product while shop peer sells the products to consumer. The value of running this network on the IBM Blockchain Platform is that you can easily customize the network infrastructure as needed, whether that is the location of the nodes, the CPU and RAM of the hardware, the endorsement policy needed to reach consensus, or adding new organizations and members to the network.

## Libraries

### [BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib)

A javascript Bitcoin library for node.js and browsers. Written in TypeScript, but committing the JS files to verify.

### [Core functionality for the XYO NodeJS projects.](https://github.com/XYOracleNetwork/sdk-core-nodejs)

Core functionality for the XYO NodeJS projects. This repository implements the core objects and services used in the XYO protocol. Additionally it provides core XYO features like performing bound-witnesses, hashing, signing, serialization, origin-chain management and TCP Network services. Alas, it exposes a number of CLI applications for running archivists and diviners.
