IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. IPFS is a peer-to-peer (p2p) storage network. Content is accessible through peers located anywhere in the world, that might relay information, store it, or do both. IPFS knows how to find what you ask for using its content address rather than its location.

IPFS is a protocol:

- Defines a content-addressed file system
- Coordinates content delivery
- Combines Kademlia + BitTorrent + Git

## [How IPFS works](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/how-ipfs-works/)

There are three fundamental principles to understanding IPFS:

- Unique identification via content addressing
- Content linking via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
- Content discovery via distributed hash tables (DHTs)
