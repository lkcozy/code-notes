## Tip

It’s one thing to build a diverse team. It’s another to build an inclusive one. To effectively do the latter, you must recognize people's similarities and differences, both of which are essential to building strong, meaningful relationships at work.

We each have a collection of characteristics, which includes observable attributes (like gender identity and race), less observable but well-known attributes (like functional expertise), and invisible attributes (like personality types and value systems). Don’t make the mistake of trying to just emphasize what everyone has in common. Pretending that differences don’t exist is a surefire way to make people feel excluded. Instead, create climates that encourage differences to come out.

At the same time, work to uncover common ground. Similarity and shared interests are the bases for close relationships. And commit to having difficult conversations instead of avoiding them. These conversations, while difficult, will enable your team to discover and respect each other's differences and discover surprising common ground — the foundations of trust and inclusion.

   <summary>🇨🇳 包容的团队承认差异和相似性</summary>

组建多样化的团队是一回事。而构建包容型则是另一回事。为了有效地做到后者，你必须认识到人们的相同点和不同点，这两者对于在工作中建立牢固而有意义的关系都是至关重要的。

我们每个人都有一系列的特征，包括可观察的属性(如性别认同和种族)，不太可见但很知名的属性(如功能性专长)，以及不可见的属性(如人格类型和价值系统)。不要错误地试图强调每个人的共同点。假装差异不存在肯定会让人们感到被排斥。相反，要创造鼓励差异出现的氛围。

与此同时，努力找出共同点。相似和共同的兴趣是亲密关系的基础。并致力于进行困难的对话，而不是回避它们。这些对话虽然困难，但能让你的团队发现并尊重彼此的差异，并发现令人惊讶的共同点——信任和包容的基础。
