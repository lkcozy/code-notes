`A feature toggle` (also feature switch, feature flag, feature gate, feature flipper, conditional feature, etc.) `is a technique` in software development that attempts to provide an alternative `to maintaining multiple branches in source code` (known as feature branches), such that a software feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. A feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the feature during runtime. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for other users.
