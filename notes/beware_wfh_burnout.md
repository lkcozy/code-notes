## Tip

The pandemic has followed us into 2021, and so has WFH burnout. As a manager, you need to be aware of how your team is really doing.

- **So check in on your employees regularly**. The simple act of communicating can relieve anxiety, but not everyone will let you know how they’re doing or what they need. So it’s incumbent on you to start these conversations and to make fair and appropriate accommodations.

- **Be ready to offer flexible work hours** whenever possible, and consider which tasks can be done asynchronously. This will give people the flexibility to manage multiple responsibilities (as many currently are).

- And **encourage your team to schedule regular “away time”**, when they’re not expected to be responsive online. These little tweaks will make a big difference as many of us continue to live in the middle ground between work and home.

   <summary>🇨🇳 警惕居家办公疲劳</summary>

疫情的蔓延已持续到 2021 年，居家办公倦怠也是如此。作为一名经理，你需要了解你的团队的实际情况。

要定期了解你的员工。简单的交流可以缓解焦虑，但并非所有人都会告诉你他们在做什么或者他们需要什么。因此，你有责任启动这些对话，做出公正合理的安排。

随时准备提供灵活的工作时间，并考虑哪些任务可以异步完成。这将使人们能够灵活地管理多项职责(正如许多人目前所做的那样)。

在不需要在线回复的情况下，鼓励团队定期安排“离线时间”。这种微小的调整将带来巨大的变化，因为我们中的许多人仍然生活在工作与家庭之间。
