## What is Polymorphism

Polymorphism comes from the word Polymorph.

- Poly: Many.
- Morph: Change from one form to another.
  So Polymorphism is the ability to take on multiple forms.

**There are three kinds of Polymorphism in programming:**

1. Adhoc Polymorphism - Change something from one form to another on the spot.
2. Parametric Polymorphism - Data that can contain many types of data or Functions that can work with many types of data
3. Subtype Polymorphisms - Create derivative objects from a parent object

## Adhoc polymorphism

### Operator Overloading

Overloading means being able to do more than one thing.

Example:

The + operator in JavaScript does many things. You can use it to add numbers. You can also use it to concatenate strings.

```js
// Adding numbers
1 + 1; // Results in 2

// Adding Strings
"Hello" + " " + "World"; // Results in 'Hello World'

// Adding Numbers to Strings
1 + "up"; // Results in '1up'
```

### Function Overloading

Function overloading means creating two (or more) functions with the same name. Each function does something different depending on the arguments given to it.

```js
function volumeCuboid(length, breadth, height) {
  return length * breadth * height;
}

function volumeCube(length) {
  return volumeCuboid(length, length, length);
}

// Overloading happens here
function calculateVolume(...args) {
  if (args.length === 3) return volumeCuboid(...args);
  return volumeCube(args[0]);
}
```

### Coercion Polymorphism

JavaScript has Type coercion. It converts value from one type to another while evaluating them.

```js
const string = "hello";
if (string) {
  console.log(string);
}
```

## Parametric Polymorphism

### Data that can contain many types of data

Everything in JavaScript is an Object. So Objects are parametric. It can be converted into other types of data.

Objects can also store multiple types. It doesn’t care what values are stored.

```js
const object = {
  str: "hello",
  num: 123,
  bool: true,
};
```

### Functions that can work with many types of data

Functions that can work with many types of data are called polymorphic functions.

```js
const toString = [1, 2, 3].map((num) => `${num}`);
```

## Subtype Polymorphism

Subtype Polymorphism involves creating derivative objects from a parent object.

Derivatives objects can then override a method from the parent and it’ll still work.

```js
class Human {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hi! My name is ${name}`);
  }
}

class Developer extends Human() {
  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hi! My name is ${name}. I am a developer.`);
  }
}

class Designer extends Human() {
  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hi! My name is ${name}. I am a designer.`);
  }
}
```
