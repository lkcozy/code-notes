## Tip

You want to support your colleagues of color. You want to call out sexist comments. You want to use inclusive language. But you can’t be a better ally unless you recognize your own privilege and then use it for good. Privilege is a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group based on an aspect of their identity, such as race, gender, wealth, education, or ability. Reflect on the ways that you have advantages and then use them to level the playing field. Here are some ways to do that.

- `Broker introductions`. A quick, “I’d love to introduce you to [name] given that you’re both interested in [topic]” can often help someone build their network and unlock opportunities that they might otherwise not have access to.
- `Help others be seen and heard`. If you hear a good idea from someone who doesn’t typically speak up, or you witness good work from someone who isn’t particularly visible, be doubly sure that others hear it, know about it, and give credit where credit is due.
- `Take on your share of the non-glamorous work`. To prevent non-promotable tasks from disproportionately falling upon women or people of color, propose taking turns so that the load is shared. If your boss asks for someone to take notes during the team meeting or for a volunteer to call in the lunch order, consider stepping up to the task.

   <summary>🇨🇳 利用你的特权成为一个更好的盟友</summary>

你想支持有色人种的同事。 你想发出性别歧视的评论。 您希望使用非独占语言。 但是，除非你认识到自己的特权，并善用它，否则你不可能成为一个更好的盟友。 特权是基于种族、性别、财富、教育或能力等身份的一个方面而授予或仅授予特定个人或群体的一种特殊权利、优势或豁免。 反省一下你有哪些优势，然后用它们来平衡竞争环境。 有一些方法可以做到这一点。

— 代理介绍。简单地说一下，我很想把你介绍给[名字]，因为你们都对[话题]感兴趣，这通常可以帮助别人建立他们的关系网，并打开他们可能无法获得的机会。

- 帮助他人被看到和听到。 如果你听到的是一个不经常直言不讳的人的好点子，或者你目睹的是一个并不特别引人注目的人的好作品，那么要加倍确信其他人听到了这个点子，知道了这个点子，并在值得称赞的地方给予赞扬。

- 承担起你那份平淡无奇的工作。为了防止非晋升任务不成比例地落在女性或有色人种身上，建议轮流做，这样就能分担工作。如果你的老板要求有人在团队会议期间做记录，或者要求一名志愿者在午餐点餐时打电话通知，那么你可以考虑着手完成这项任务。
