## What Are GitHub Actions?

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) allow you to run arbitrary code in response to [events](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows). Events are activities that happen on GitHub such as:

- Opening a pull request
- Making an issue comment
- Labeling an issue
- Creating a new branch
  ‚Ä¶ and many more

```yml
name: üöÄ Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy_source:
    name: build and deploy lambda
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1.4.2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies, Build application and Zip dist folder contents
        run: yarn install  && zip -qq -r -j ./bundle.zip ./test/*
      - name: deploy zip to aws lambda
        uses: appleboy/lambda-action@master
        with:
          aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws_region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
          function_name: kan_test
          zip_file: bundle.zip
```

## [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

Workflow files use YAML syntax, and must have either a .yml or .yaml file extension. If you're new to YAML and want to learn more, see "[Learn YAML in five minutes.](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214409/Learn-YAML-in-five-minutes)"

**name**: The name of your workflow.

**on(required)**: The name of the GitHub event that triggers the workflow. You can provide a single event `string`, `array` of events, `array` of event types

Example using a single event

```yml
# Trigger on push
on: push
```

Example using a list of events

```yml
# Trigger the workflow on push or pull request
on: [push, pull_request]
```

Example using multiple events with activity types or configuration

```yml
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request,
  # but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - "releases/**"
    paths:
      - "**.js"
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
  # Also trigger on page_build, as well as release created events
  page_build:
  release:
    types: # This configuration does not affect the page_build event above
      - created
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron: "*/15 * * * *"
```

**jobs**: A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs run in parallel by default. You can run an unlimited number of jobs as long as you are within the workflow usage limits. For more information, see "[Usage limits](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#usage-limits)."

```yaml
jobs:
  my_first_job:
    name: My first job
  my_second_job:
    name: My second job
```

Identifies any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run.

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
  job2:
    needs: job1
  job3:
    needs: [job1, job2]
```

**runs-on**: The type of machine to run the job on. The machine can be either a [GitHub-hosted runner](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#github-hosted-runners), or a self-hosted runner.

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**steps**: A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps.

- Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an action in your repository, a public repository, or an action published in a Docker registry.
- Not all steps run actions, but all actions run as a step.
- Run unlimited number of steps as long as you are within the workflow usage limits

```yaml
steps:
  - name: My first step
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
    run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
```

**uses**: Selects an action to run as part of a step in your job.

- An action is a reusable unit of code.
- You can use an action defined in the same repository as the workflow, a public repository, or in a published Docker container image.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: My first step
    # Uses the master branch of a public repository
    uses: actions/heroku@master
  - name: My second step
    # Uses a specific version tag of a public repository
    uses: actions/aws@v2.0.1
```

**with**: A map of the input parameters defined by the action.

- Each input parameter is a key/value pair.
- Input parameters are set as environment variables.
- The variable is prefixed with INPUT and converted to upper case.

```
jobs:
  my_first_job:
    steps:
      - name: My first step
        uses: actions/hello_world@master
        with:
          first_name: Mona
          middle_name: The
          last_name: Octocat
```

## Example

### Deploy your projects to Github Pages

```yaml

build-and-deploy:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
      uses: actions/checkout@v2 # If you're using actions/checkout@v2 you must set persist-credentials to false in most cases for the deployment to work correctly.
      with:
        persist-credentials: false

    - name: Install and Build üîß # This example project is built using npm and outputs the result to the 'build' folder. Replace with the commands required to build your project, or remove this step entirely if your site is pre-built.
      run: |
        yarn install
        yarn run build

    - name: Deploy üöÄ
      uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        BRANCH: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
        FOLDER: build # The folder the action should deploy.
```
