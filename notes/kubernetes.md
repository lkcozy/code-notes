Kubernetes is an open-source `container-orchestration system` for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

- A container is, in simple terms, means a virtual machine without its own Operating system.
- A container orchestrator tells the containers to where they should stay and how they should behave.
- In the usual production environment, there are hundreds and thousands of containers dedicated to various microservices.
- Manage multiple containers is not a simple task. They need updates, version control, health checks, scaling and many more functionalities to be performed on them.
- Very platform-agnostic.
- Not tied with any other specific company or platform like Docker.
