# Literature Review 2021-04-26

## Objectives

- `provide a generic, scalable, and easy-to-manage access control system for IoT.`
- implement a PoC that proves the design
- prove the architecture's `feasibility rather than security.`
- Do not focus on the evaluation of the Ethereum network
- `manage the entire lifecycle access policies` of the IoT devices regardless of their location or provenance.

## Why it matters

- Internet of Things (IoT) has become a technology with a large influence across many vertical markets
- One of the technical challenges of having billions of devices deployed worldwide is the ability to manage them
- Current IoT access management technologies are based `on centralized models` which introduce a new variety of technical `limitations to manage them globally.`
- Centralized access control systems `lack the ability to deal with increased load efficiently.`

## How it works

- using Ethereum
- introduces a new access management system that mitigates the issues associated with managing numerous constrained IoT devices
- The architecture is backed by a proof of concept implementation and evaluated in realistic IoT scenarios
- The solution is fully decentralized and based on blockchain technology
- The IoT devices do not belong to the blockchain network, which `makes easier `integrating the current IoT devices `to adapt to our system.`

## Results

- The results show that the blockchain technology could be used `as access management technology in specific scalable IoT scenarios.`
- address the scalability problem of managing access to billions of constrained devices in the IoT
- the solution scales well since numerous constrained networks can be connected simultaneously to the blockchain network `using specific nodes called management hub nodes.`
- the solution can `adapt to various IoT scenarios` confirming that blockchain technology can embrace IoT technology at its fullest

## I'm thinking

## Related

- Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain-based distributed computing platforms

- Literature already provides extensive analysis and benchmarking of the platform and its clients regarding performance and scalability capabilities.
