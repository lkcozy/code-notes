Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

## [A Detailed Overview of AWS API Gateway](https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/api-gateway-elements/)

## API Endpoints

- Edge-optimized: default API endpoint to access through a CloudFront distribution that is created and managed by API Gateway.
- Regional: an endpoint is a type of endpoint that is accessed from the same AWS region in which your REST API is deployed. This helps you `reduce request latency` when API requests originate from the same region as your REST API.
