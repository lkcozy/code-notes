## Tip

As a team leader, it’s easy to assume that everyone working together on a project should be treated and managed the same way. But full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors have different motivations, expectations, and needs.
As a manager, you need to be conscious of those distinctions and adjust accordingly.

Begin by `holding one-on-one or small-group discussions with your FTEs, and then with your contractors` to understand what people want to get out of the project personally and professionally.

With these insights in mind, `focus on team-building and alignment`. Have a team-wide conversation to ensure that everyone is on the same page about the project’s overall goals, its organizational context, and the individuals involved — and reinforce this alignment throughout the project as needed.

Finally, `set clear ground rules and guidelines around communication, resources, and roles, aiming to fulfill everyone's distinct needs`. This will set clear expectations and ensure that no resentment builds up throughout the project.

作为一名团队领导，我们很容易认为，在一个项目中，每个人都应该得到同样的对待和管理。 但全职雇员和合同工有着不同的动机、期望和需求。作为一个经理，你需要意识到这些区别，并做出相应的调整。

首先和你的全职雇员们进行一对一的或者小组的讨论，然后和你的承包商一起了解人们想从项目中得到什么。

带着这些洞察力，专注于团队建设和协调。进行一次团队范围的对话，以确保每个人对项目的总体目标、组织环境和所涉及的个人都有相同的看法，并根据需要在整个项目中加强这种一致性。

最后，围绕沟通、资源和角色制定明确的基本规则和指导方针，以满足每个人的不同需求。 这将设定明确的期望，并确保不会在整个项目中产生怨恨。
