The most important trait of a world class team is that everyone is rowing in the same direction.¬†
You have to create a plan, constantly evaluate it and be explicit about every decision you make.

It takes a strong level of awareness to not only create a world class team, but also make sure they stay that way. Here's some tips as you think through your strategy:

- **Invest in experience**. The higher cost of talent will buy you a higher level of strategic thinking, intuition and leadership which all leads to a better quality end result. `The optimal team size is between 3 and 9 members, with teams of 7 displaying the most efficiencies`. The key here is to carefully manage your team in accordance to your requirements.
- **Personality is as important as skill**. A smart individual with a stubborn personality will cause more harm than good. Surround yourself with people that are able to work together to constantly raise the bar for each other.
- **Put emphasis on professional growth early**. Individual growth will benefit you, invest in it. Make sure your strategy includes the ability for your people to be constantly growing to help you build a better product.
- **Be intentional with decision making**. Consensus management will accelerate your path to entropy. Don't let politics and personal bias get in the way of technical correctness, and don't strive to be a democracy. Trust the smart people to make the hard decisions. Focus on finding the right answer, not winning the most arguments.
- **Equip the team with the right tools**. The worst thing you can do is invest is smart people and create a great plan, but not set them up for success. Without the right tools, very little gets done regardless of anything else.-
