## Tip

The most effective route is to `get a sponsor with power and have them advocate on your behalf for an immediate1 catch-up`.

First, `find out who's got the power`. The self-advocacy is not effective at all. . Only the people with visibility into how folks are being paid at various levels and disciplines are HR, and managers. With that visibility comes power: they’re the ones who can make a case for a correction, and they’re the ones who, if they’re not paying attention or aren’t incentivized, can perpetuate wage gaps.

Then, `turn those with power into your sponsors`. Find someone who you trust in a place of authority. It’s best if they’re in your reporting chain, but it’s okay if they’re not, so long as you trust them to keep your best interest at heart.Explain to them that you discovered that a peer is making significantly more than you do, and ask open questions to figure out what can be done about it.

Last, `give your sponsors enough details to correct gaps`. Give them details like “my peer and I have both worked here for N years”, “we have both shipped XYZ projects”, and “we have both received promotions at the same time”. Your sponsor will want to build a case for fairness in pay across equivalent skill, tenure, level, etc. - which will hopefully combat any arguments based on unconscious biases from those who made the original compensation decision.

   <summary>🇨🇳 处理你的工资差距</summary>

最有效的途径是找一个有实力的赞助者，让他们代表你进行宣传，立即赶上进度。

首先，找出谁有权力。自我宣传根本没有效果。只有人力资源部和经理能够了解员工在不同级别和不同纪律下的薪酬情况。随着这种可见性而来的是权力：他们是可以提出纠正理由的人，如果他们不注意或没有受到激励，他们可能会使工资差距永久化。

然后，把那些有权力的人变成你的赞助者。找一个你信任的有权威的人。如果他们在你的报告链中是最好的，但如果他们不在，也没关系，只要你相信他们会把你的最大利益放在心上。向他们解释，你发现一位同龄人的收入远远高于你，并提出开放性问题，找出可以采取的措施。

最后，给你的赞助商提供足够的细节来弥补差距。告诉他们一些细节，比如我和我的同事都在这里工作了 N 年，我们都发布了 XYZ 项目，我们都同时获得了升职。你的赞助者会想要在同等技能、任期、水平等方面建立一个公平薪酬的案例——这将有希望与做出最初薪酬决定的人基于无意识偏见的任何争论作斗争。
