- **Use a comment when it is infeasible to make your code `self-explanatory`**
- Avoid comments that just repeat what the code does
- When to comment
  - `Reveal your intent`: explain why the code does something as opposed to what it does.
  - `Protect` a well-meaning future editor from mistakenly `fixing` your code
  - `Clarification`: a question that came up during code review or that readers of the code might have.
  - Explain your rationale for what looks like a bad software engineering practice
