## Federated GraphQL Microservices

`Federation is an architecture for composing two or more graphs (called subgraphs) into a single data graph (called a supergraph).` A supergraphâ€™s schema is made up of all the composed subgraph schemas, plus some metadata.

One of the key principles of GraphQL involves having a single data graph of the implementing services that will allow the client to have a unified interface to access more data and services through a single query.

## [Subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/)

> Subscriptions are not currently supported in Apollo Federation.

Subscriptions are long-lasting GraphQL read operations that can update their result whenever a particular server-side event occurs. Most commonly, updated results are pushed from the server to subscribing clients. For example, a chat application's server might use a subscription to push newly received messages to all clients in a particular chat room.

## [Using Subscriptions with a Federated Data Graph](https://github.com/apollographql/federation-subscription-tools)

This demonstration library shows how a decoupled subscription service can run alongside a federated data graph to provide real-time updates to a client.

## [Apollo AWS Lambda with GraphQL subscriptions](https://github.com/michalkvasnicak/aws-lambda-graphql)

With this library you can do:

same things as with apollo-server-lambda by utiizing AWS API Gateway v1
GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket by utilizing AWS API Gateway v2 and subscriptions-transport-ws
