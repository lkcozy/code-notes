`Federation is an architecture for composing two or more graphs (called subgraphs) into a single data graph (called a supergraph).` A supergraph‚Äôs schema is made up of all the composed subgraph schemas, plus some metadata.

One of the key principles of GraphQL involves having a single data graph of the implementing services that will allow the client to have a unified interface to access more data and services through a single query.
