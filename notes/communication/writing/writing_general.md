## Tech

- Bit `facilitates` the process of collaborating on UI components.
- Apollo Workbench is a design tool that `facilitates` planning changes to your supergraph.
- Gentle `nudge` to everybody, please do sth
- A stub, `in this context, means a mock implementation
- In some specific cases, though, avoiding the adoption is entirely justified.
- Sth is a hyped language with an unknown future.
- Anyone who has worked with timestamps will know that there are dozens of different conventions for date and time, and it's painful to work with them—every time you need to work with time, things get complicated!
- One thing to note when using time data is that the use of ISO timestamp format `is generally recommended.`
- Experience shows that there might be a number of potential surprises you should be aware of when working with multiple time zones.
- They would assume that the problem was how you are `approaching the problem,` regardless of how hard the problem actually was
- With all due respect: we are completely clueless about how long things should take.
- It maybe more or less `case by case.`
- It would be `impractical` to do sth due to the cost and time `implications`
- I'll also share this with the rest of the team to take to heart for future improvements.
- It seems there is no urgency to do anything quickly or `in a cost-effective manner.
- Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects that `implied` cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
- As was monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate interest, making it harder to implement.
- Why do we `accumulate` technical debt?
- This would also help the teams avoid the technical debt trap.
- When it chooses to delay better coding and building internal pieces, the debt should be there `for various reasons.
- The graphic below shows an `admittedly` simplified representation of a `typical setup` for machine learning.
- While some doctors `are skeptical of` AI, others may trust it too much, which also can lead to errors.
- Practitioners in 'a wide variety of fields will need to `cultivate a balance `between `skepticism and trust` in machine learning systems.
- This is `extensively` discussed in the repo.
- AWS Lambda and API Gateway are incredible flexible, but they can `be tedious to` set up, especially for simple scenarios.
- Generic frameworks support more runtimes, but leave the developers to deal with language-specific issues.
- It s a trap. Avoid focusing on `vanity metrics` in software testing.
- Because these vanity metrics — not always a true reflection of quality.
- The only way to avoid more bugs is to not ship more software, and that’s not a solution.
- Many tests are useless because they are incredibly unlikely to fail.
- The amount of effort invested, versus having a set of smoke tests of critical features was very `arguably a misuse of time`
- The hard work comes `when we get into` refactoring and consolidation.
- The reason for this is the `sheer size` of the network of IoT devices that can locate AirTags.
- The issue count doesn’t `correlate` to code quality
- The urql has `advantages over` Apollo Client `when it comes to` its unified community, great documentation, and first-party plugins and caching system.
- Show `initiative` by finding answers on your own if they're already published.
- Having a bug tracking system doesn't `make` bug handling `efficient` and CI/CD doesn't mean your time to deliver `is necessarily short`.
- A system design interview `entails asking` a candidate to design a system that solves a specific problem.
- You have spent `a considerable amount of time internalizing` its solution space, scalability limitations, tradeoffs, and failure modes.
- For readability we recommend against using more than 80 characters.
- When humans write code, they don't `strive to` reach the maximum number of columns on every line.
- I will be following the convention of naming an Observable variable with a $ suffix
- We'll have to `differentiate between` the attributes we want to filter and search on.

## General

- The lighter your shoes, the faster you can `zip around`(move) the court.
- An average year would `feature`(have) 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.
- Perhaps the most `intriguing`(attractive) reason is the search for extraterrestrial life.
- This `intriguing` book is both thoughtful and informative.
- `Factoring in`(Considering) its construction and operation, the drone cost $85 million.
- `Effortlessly` go from the golf course to dinner in this `tastefully striped` cotton polo.
- She `bluntly`(directly,without considering other people's feeling) said that didn’t matter.
- Writing is `the act of dissecting ideas` and putting them back together again.
- The best way to understand an idea is to pull it apart and put it back together again, which you do by writing.
- Remember that things tend to be fluid, re-organizations happens often
- But by ignoring the `wisdom of crowds`, he’s attracted `an ocean of like-minded` super fans.
- Depending on the article, you can `either` write for yourself `or` one other person.
- My writing is `a protest against` the superficial babble that passes for `intellectual discourse.`
- I fully expect you to `weigh in with` your own opinions.
- If you feel differently, please `weigh in with` comments.
- The key to `breaking this circle` is to become more `aware of` the reward reinforcing your behavior.
- Your bad behaviors may not change immediately, but `stick with it`.

## Management

- If you `lead through` intimidation, or if you lead through fear, then that's not leadership.
- You have to `lead through collaboration` and `cajoling(persuading)`, not control.
- Like trust, respect is also something you earn-and by `leading through your actions, not your words`.
- Taking a broad, systemic view of the issues at hand
- This is a perfect opportunity to `reflect on` how you want your team to operate differently going forward.
- Start by `identifying` which new practices were successful, why they were successful, and `under which circumstance` they'll continue to be useful.
- Most people will `instinctively` revert to old routines. So `reinforce` the new practices and procedures until they `turn into` habits.
- When you develop a reasonable narrative, you can `proactively` address these concerns and make the best possible impression.
- Focus on you accomplishments `rather than` your time spent in each role.
- `Emphasize` how working alongside different leadership styles has `contributed to` your professional growth.
- Highlight how each experience `exposed you to` best practices.
- Shifting your mindset `in this way` will help you start to build genuine relationship.
- Scrum is a way to take a below average or poor developer and `turn them into` an average developer.
- It's also great at taking great developers and turning them into average developers.
- Scrum exists because managers don't trust developers to get things done without constant supervision.
- He’s a `well-read` startup founder whose `appetite for rigorous thinking` is balanced by an impatience for `hollow ideas`
- Look for opportunities to `build up` your team's `capacity`, and `delegate` when you can.
- This self-audit will help you `paint a more realistic picture` of how your future calendar will be populated.
- `Take the pulse of` your team.
- Stay focus on future opportunities and your `collective` goals.
- `The bottom line` is that we have to make a decision today.
- Identify the `least disruptive way` to gather the information you need from someone else.
- Don't make your request `without context`.
- Create space for `reconciliation` and establish a direction for the future.
- Most bad leaders' actions are `rooted in` good intentions.
- Do your best to `oblige`.

- They'll be more likely to `bet on you` the next time a promotion opportunity `opens up`.
- How can you `channel` feelings of self-doubt into something more constructive and productive?
- `Ironically`, you appear more confident when you `demonstrate the humility` and courage to ask about what you don't know.
- Assume good will from the feedback giver.

## Basketball

- I know the perception of me is that I can score the basketball well.
- I'm aware that the public perceives me as a good basketball scorer.
- i've been asked to do pretty much everything from rebounding to defending to initiating to scoring.
