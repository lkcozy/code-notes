## Tech

- Bit `facilitates` the process of collaborating on UI components.
- Apollo Workbench is a design tool that `facilitates` planning changes to your supergraph.
- Gentle `nudge` to everybody, please do sth
- A stub, `in this context, means a mock implementation
- In some specific cases, though, avoiding the adoption is entirely justified.
- Sth is a hyped language with an unknown future.
- Anyone who has worked with timestamps will know that there are dozens of different conventions for date and time, and it's painful to work with them—every time you need to work with time, things get complicated!
- One thing to note when using time data is that the use of ISO timestamp format `is generally recommended.`
- Experience shows that there might be a number of potential surprises you should be aware of when working with multiple time zones.
- They would assume that the problem was how you are `approaching the problem,` regardless of how hard the problem actually was
- With all due respect: we are completely clueless about how long things should take.
- It maybe more or less `case by case.`
- It would be `impractical` to do sth due to the cost and time `implications`
- I'll also share this with the rest of the team to take to heart for future improvements.
- It seems there is no urgency to do anything quickly or `in a cost-effective manner.
- Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects that `implied` cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
- As was monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate interest, making it harder to implement.
- Why do we `accumulate` technical debt?
- This would also help the teams avoid the technical debt trap.
- When it chooses to delay better coding and building internal pieces, the debt should be there `for various reasons.
- The graphic below shows an `admittedly` simplified representation of a `typical setup` for machine learning.
- While some doctors `are skeptical of` AI, others may trust it too much, which also can lead to errors.
- Practitioners in 'a wide variety of fields will need to `cultivate a balance `between `skepticism and trust` in machine learning systems.
- This is `extensively` discussed in the repo.
- AWS Lambda and API Gateway are incredible flexible, but they can `be tedious to` set up, especially for simple scenarios.
- Generic frameworks support more runtimes, but leave the developers to deal with language-specific issues.
- It s a trap. Avoid focusing on `vanity metrics` in software testing.
- Because these vanity metrics — not always a true reflection of quality.
- The only way to avoid more bugs is to not ship more software, and that’s not a solution.
- Many tests are useless because they are incredibly unlikely to fail.
- The amount of effort invested, versus having a set of smoke tests of critical features was very `arguably a misuse of time`
- The hard work comes `when we get into` refactoring and consolidation.

## General

- The lighter your shoes, the faster you can `zip around`(move) the court.

- An average year would `feature`(have) 14 named storms and seven hurricanes.
- Perhaps the most `intriguing`(attractive) reason is the search for extraterrestrial life.
- This `intriguing` book is both thoughtful and informative.
- `Factoring in`(Considering) its construction and operation, the drone cost $85 million.
- `Effortlessly` go from the golf course to dinner in this `tastefully striped` cotton polo.
- She `bluntly`(directly,without considering other people's feeling) said that didn’t matter.

## Management

- If you `lead through` intimidation, or if you lead through fear, then that's not leadership.
- You have to `lead through collaboration` and `cajoling(persuading)`, not control.
- Like trust, respect is also something you earn-and by `leading through your actions, not your words`.
- Taking a broad, systemic view of the issues at hand
