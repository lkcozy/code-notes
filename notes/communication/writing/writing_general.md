## Tech

- Bit `facilitates` the process of collaborating on UI components.
- Apollo Workbench is a design tool that `facilitates` planning changes to your supergraph.
- Gentle `nudge` to everybody, please do sth
- A stub, `in this context, means a mock implementation
- In some specific cases, though, avoiding the adoption is entirely justified.
- Sth is a hyped language with an unknown future.
- Anyone who has worked with timestamps will know that there are dozens of different conventions for date and time, and it's painful to work with them—every time you need to work with time, things get complicated!
- One thing to note when using time data is that the use of ISO timestamp format `is generally recommended.`
- Experience shows that there might be a number of potential surprises you should be aware of when working with multiple time zones.
- They would assume that the problem was how you are `approaching the problem,` regardless of how hard the problem actually was
- With all due respect: we are completely clueless about how long things should take.
- It maybe more or less `case by case.`
- It would be `impractical` to do sth due to the cost and time `implications`
- I'll also share this with the rest of the team to take to heart for future improvements.
- It seems there is no urgency to do anything quickly or `in a cost-effective manner.
- Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects that `implied` cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
- As was monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate interest, making it harder to implement.
- Why do we `accumulate` technical debt?
- This would also help the teams avoid the technical debt trap.
- When it chooses to delay better coding and building internal pieces, the debt should be there `for various reasons.
- The graphic below shows an `admittedly` simplified representation of a `typical setup` for machine learning.
- While some doctors `are skeptical of` AI, others may trust it too much, which also can lead to errors.
- Practitioners in 'a wide variety of fields will need to `cultivate a balance` between `skepticism and trust` in machine learning systems.
- This is `extensively` discussed in the repo.
- AWS Lambda and API Gateway are incredible flexible, but they can `be tedious to` set up, especially for simple scenarios.
- Generic frameworks support more runtimes, but leave the developers to deal with language-specific issues.
- It s a trap. Avoid focusing on `vanity metrics` in software testing.
- Because these vanity metrics — not always a true reflection of quality.
- The only way to avoid more bugs is to not ship more software, and that’s not a solution.
- Many tests are useless because they are incredibly unlikely to fail.
- The amount of effort invested, versus having a set of smoke tests of critical features was very `arguably a misuse of time`
- The hard work comes `when we get into` refactoring and consolidation.
- The reason for this is the `sheer size` of the network of IoT devices that can locate AirTags.
- The issue count doesn’t `correlate` to code quality
- The urql has `advantages over` Apollo Client `when it comes to` its unified community, great documentation, and first-party plugins and caching system.
- Show `initiative` by finding answers on your own if they're already published.
- Having a bug tracking system doesn't `make` bug handling `efficient` and CI/CD doesn't mean your time to deliver `is necessarily short`.
- A system design interview `entails asking` a candidate to design a system that solves a specific problem.
- You have spent `a considerable amount of time internalizing` its solution space, scalability limitations, tradeoffs, and failure modes.
- For readability we recommend against using more than 80 characters.
- When humans write code, they don't `strive to` reach the maximum number of columns on every line.
- I will be following the convention of naming an Observable variable with a $ suffix
- We'll have to `differentiate between` the attributes we want to filter and search on.
- I `vaguely` recall this relating to sth
- This is more `versatile`
- This is not the fault of the `presumably`(by reasonable assumption) `well-intentioned` extension authors.
- Technical lead is a position that requires `intricate`(complex) calibration of various personality `traits`(feature)
- This feature is a `tremendous`(huge) `addition`(complement/supplement) to the TypeScript language.
- It should have a significant, long-term, positive impact on how people write code with TypeScript.
- In JavaScript, we often have to `probe`(examine) a variable in different ways to see if it has a more specific type that we can use.
- `Interconnectivity` is crucial to the survival of innovative technologies.
- The `allure`(attraction) of a strong tech ecosystem
- Teaching kids to write code has been a topic of `intense debate` for the past decade or so.
- Instead of looking at them as a competitor, think of the person as a `potential ally` who might help you achieve your goals
