- Bit `facilitates` the process of collaborating on UI components.
- Gentle `nudge` to everybody please do sth
- A stub, `in this context`, means a mock implementation
- In some specific cases, though, avoiding the adoption is entirely justified.
- Sth is a hyped language with an unknown future.
- Anyone who has worked with timestamps will know that there are dozens of different conventions for date and time, and it‚Äôs painful to work with them‚Äîevery time you need to work with time, things get complicated!
- One thing to note when using time data is that the use of ISO timestamp format `is generally recommended`.
- Experience shows that there might be a number of potential surprises you should be aware of when working with multiple time zones.
- They would assume that the problem was how you are `approaching the problem`, regardless of how hard the problem actually was
- With all due respect: we are completely clueless about how long things should take.

- It would be `impractical` to do sth due to the cost and time `implications`
- I'll also share this with the rest of the team to take to heart for future improvements.
