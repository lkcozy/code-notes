## Misc

- Analyzing 4D data is highly complex `as` it requires both temporal and spatial correlations `to be taken into account`.
- Assessing both the temporal and spatial dimensions of data `adds significant complexity` to the data analysis process.
- At a time of rising climate change impacts, there is a vital and growing need to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters.
- But there is a critical communication gap between authorities and citizens.

## Introduction

- Our goal is to explore the option of developing a system that facilitates anonymity and trustworthiness. To achieve this, the following objectives are outlined:

## Methods

- Based on the stated research objectives, we designed a blockchain-driven architecture that `comprises` of the following major segments.
- The generic outlook of the conceptualize architecture is presented in Figure.
- It is expected that this architecture will facilitates transparency of the data while protecting the privacy of users.
- The various major layers are described as follows
- The data that is stored in the cache is not stored in the raw form. Rather, it is encrypted using an asymmetric encryption technique.

## Conclusion
