## Tech

- Bit `facilitates` the process of collaborating on UI components.
- Apollo Workbench is a design tool that `facilitates` planning changes to your supergraph.
- Gentle `nudge` to everybody, please do sth
- A stub, `in this context, means a mock implementation
- In some specific cases, though, avoiding the adoption is entirely justified.
- Sth is a hyped language with an unknown future.
- Anyone who has worked with timestamps will know that there are dozens of different conventions for date and time, and it's painful to work with them‚Äîevery time you need to work with time, things get complicated!
- One thing to note when using time data is that the use of ISO timestamp format `is generally recommended.`
- Experience shows that there might be a number of potential surprises you should be aware of when working with multiple time zones.
- They would assume that the problem was how you are `approaching the problem,` regardless of how hard the problem actually was
- With all due respect: we are completely clueless about how long things should take.
- It maybe more or less `case by case.`
- It would be `impractical` to do sth due to the cost and time `implications`
- I'll also share this with the rest of the team to take to heart for future improvements.
- It seems there is no urgency to do anything quickly or `in a cost-effective manner.
- Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects that `implied` cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
- As was monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate interest, making it harder to implement.
- Why do we `accumulate` technical debt?
- This would also help the teams avoid the technical debt trap.
- When it chooses to delay better coding and building internal pieces, the debt should be there `for various reasons.
- The graphic below shows an `admittedly` simplified representation of a `typical setup` for machine learning.
- While some doctors `are skeptical of` AI, others may trust it too much, which also can lead to errors.
- Practitioners in 'a wide variety of fields will need to `cultivate a balance` between `skepticism and trust` in machine learning systems.
- This is `extensively` discussed in the repo.
- AWS Lambda and API Gateway are incredible flexible, but they can `be tedious to` set up, especially for simple scenarios.
- Generic frameworks support more runtimes, but leave the developers to deal with language-specific issues.
- It s a trap. Avoid focusing on `vanity metrics` in software testing.
- Because these vanity metrics ‚Äî not always a true reflection of quality.
- The only way to avoid more bugs is to not ship more software, and that‚Äôs not a solution.
- Many tests are useless because they are incredibly unlikely to fail.
- The amount of effort invested, versus having a set of smoke tests of critical features was very `arguably a misuse of time`
- The hard work comes `when we get into` refactoring and consolidation.
- The reason for this is the `sheer size` of the network of IoT devices that can locate AirTags.
- The issue count doesn‚Äôt `correlate` to code quality
- The urql has `advantages over` Apollo Client `when it comes to` its unified community, great documentation, and first-party plugins and caching system.
- Show `initiative` by finding answers on your own if they're already published.
- Having a bug tracking system doesn't `make` bug handling `efficient` and CI/CD doesn't mean your time to deliver `is necessarily short`.
- A system design interview `entails asking` a candidate to design a system that solves a specific problem.
- You have spent `a considerable amount of time internalizing` its solution space, scalability limitations, tradeoffs, and failure modes.
- For readability we recommend against using more than 80 characters.
- When humans write code, they don't `strive to` reach the maximum number of columns on every line.
- I will be following the convention of naming an Observable variable with a $ suffix
- We'll have to `differentiate between` the attributes we want to filter and search on.
- I `vaguely` recall this relating to sth
- This is more `versatile`
- This is not the fault of the `presumably`(by reasonable assumption) `well-intentioned` extension authors.
- Technical lead is a position that requires `intricate`(complex) calibration of various personality `traits`(feature)
- This feature is a `tremendous`(huge) `addition`(complement/supplement) to the TypeScript language.
- It should have a significant, long-term, positive impact on how people write code with TypeScript.
- In JavaScript, we often have to `probe`(examine) a variable in different ways to see if it has a more specific type that we can use.
- `Interconnectivity` is crucial to the survival of innovative technologies.
- The `allure`(attraction) of a strong tech ecosystem
- Teaching kids to write code has been a topic of `intense debate` for the past decade or so.
- Instead of looking at them as a competitor, think of the person as a `potential ally` who might help you achieve your goals
- This issue sometimes `manifests`(demonstrate) as concept `drift`
- It cannot `count on` the United States to `supply` its technology, and it must `cultivate`(foster) domestic alternatives.
- The combined efforts of the drive and its innovative industry will `accelerate`(speed up) the country‚Äôs technological `advancement`(development).
- It could have had a `ripple effect`(chain reaction) across the country
- The basic idea of `orthogonality` is that things that are not related conceptually should not be related in the system.
- There‚Äôs a `delicate` balance between protecting the rights of consumers and limiting the freedoms of content providers who rely on platforms to get their message out.
- Some aspects of this challenge have been left intentionally `vague`(non clear
- Please complete what you deem necessary and prioritize accordingly
- The request for tabs in Explorer, especially, has been `overwhelming`(strongly desired).
- The `underlying` cause of this outage also impacted many internal tools, `complicating` our attempts to quickly `diagnose` and resolve the problem.
- This disruption to network traffic had a `cascading` effect on the way our data centers communicate, bringing our services to a `halt`(stop).
- Working extra hours or weekends should only happen on go live situations. All the other deadlines on projects are artificial and only there because the plan has it.
- A complex system that works is `invariably`(always) found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
- I think we entrepreneurs are `vulnerable`(easy) to admiring the results rather than the process.
- Some tools are good for high performance and scaling, but hard to work with, `whereas` others are easy to work with but are not as fast as other tools.
- It `won't be worth` worrying about the cost `at the scale` of a few messages.
- At the highest level, cross-platform UI technologies `prioritize` coordinated featurefulness over polished UX.

## Blockchain

- An increase in difficulty made CPU mining `obsolete`(outdated) and miners started moving to GPUs.
- The time between `successive`(consecutive/sequent) Bitcoin blocks decreases from the approximate 10 mins
- What happens if the price of Bitcoin `pegged`(tied) to `fiat`(legal) currencies like the US dollar goes up
- The mining datacenters are primarily located in countries with a cooler climate and cheaper electricity so as to `drive their recurring costs down`.
- Due to the high `upfront cost`, lack of `general availability`, and power requirements,a lot of hobbyists miners mine other cryptocurrencies, also called Altcoins.
- Encourage them to develop more `empathy`(another's feeling) and consider their colleagues‚Äô `perspectives` and `viewpoints`
- Don‚Äôt expect your efforts to `yield`(bring) immediate results
- These instructions are `collectively referred` to as the ‚Äúconsensus protocol‚Äù

## AI/ML

- These problems will `recede`(weaken) as data-centric AI tools and methodologies `evolve`.
- Tesla‚Äôs promise of full self-driving capability was `premature`

## [Developer](https://itnext.io/developers-are-the-most-valuable-resource-when-creating-software-but-their-time-is-undervalued-and-85aab08d7af7)

- Development is not just writing code, understand the complete solution, understand how the business works and the requirements.
- Developers need to work with the other people on the project, know who to ask for help, know how to ask.
- More developers add complexity and makes communication harder. It can slow development rather than speed it up.
- Creating software needs blocks of uninterrupted time for deep work.
- Constantly interrupted developers with meetings will create non-development tasks and a task switching overhead.
- Don‚Äôt let problems jump from other roles to the developers‚Äô backs.
- Know how to use the hooks and use it wisely with performance optimizations
- Improve the code quality and the attention to detail
- Thoroughly test the feature and take pride in the work
- Take the work seriously before indicating that it is ready to be reviewed
- The advantage of creating types this way is that you keep your types in sync.
- Changes to the properties of the parent type are automatically adopted by the derived one.

## Negotiation

- Since my timeline is now compressed, is there anything you can do to `expedite`(speed up) the process?
- I wonder if this is a recent change?
