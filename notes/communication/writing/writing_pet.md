- One of my furbabies had `frequent bouts` of diarrhea the other `had little interest` in eating.
- I tried them out and no more diarrhea and the other eats `ravenously`(hungrily)

## Eye

- My dog had a `semi-swollen` eye, and I tried flushing it out with water, but it didn't appear to help much other than remove `gunk`.
- Is the eyeball itself that is `swollen`, that eye is bigger than the other eye, or is the swelling around the eye, like the eyelids?
- If this eye truly appears larger than the opposite eye, this could be `glaucoma`, and glaucoma is a medical emergency; even waiting one day can make a difference it `keeping his sight`.
- If the swelling is around the eye, the eyelids and surrounding area, then it might be something like an `infection` or `allergic` reaction.
- You can try cool compresses to take down swelling of the eyelids.
