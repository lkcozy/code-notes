Engineering is a team effort. Engineers learn from one another, challenge and improve upon each other's decisions, and depend on one another for code reviews. But what do you do when you and a coworker have a technical disagreement, and you just can‚Äôt seem to get anywhere?

I like to work with individuals who demonstrate maturity, and the ability to navigate disagreements and resolve them productively signifies maturity to me. Here are some tactics that I like to use to resolve technical disagreements.

- strive for objectivity
  - Try to uncouple your ego from the discussion so you don't feel threatened by other people's ideas.
  - Shift the dynamic of the conversation from ‚Äúme vs. you‚Äù to ‚Äúus vs. a problem‚Äù.
  - Try to articulate and agree on your goals.
  - Draw up lists of pros and cons for each solution you're considering
- take time to prepare your case
  - Discussions are not productive if your grasp of an idea is still fuzzy.
  - Everyone involved should take some time to think through their points of view
  - be able to clearly explain their line of reasoning.
- understand the other person's ideas and Points
  - Make a good-faith effort to see their point of view.
  - Remember, your teammate has the same good intentions that you have.
  - Get curious. Ask as many questions as you need to ask until you understand the other person‚Äôs proposal well enough to communicate it back to them.
  - This will let you address each point directly or sometimes come around to the other person's perspective.
- identify and acknowledge your assumptions
  - uncertainties, and gut feelings. ‚ÄúI guess what I‚Äôm worried about is‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I understand why/what/how‚Ä¶‚Äù are good ways to begin this line of thought
  - This will open the door for collaboration and let your team help you address your concerns
- say you can convince me if
  - list what things the other person needs to prove to make you change your mind
  - This exercise will help you both be objective, and will also force you to think through and understand what really matters to you
- step away for cool-off period
  - If discussion gets heated then emotion is probably interfering with your ability to think and communicate clearly
  - Agree to take a break for a few hours or a day and then try again later.
  - If you feel embarrassed about getting emotional, it can help to acknowledge what happened
  - Sorry I got a little worked up back there! You can tell I'm passionate about this, but I don't want to let emotion affect our decisions."
  - Most people can relate.
- just build it
  - If discussion doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting anywhere, try proving your idea with code.
  - build a prototype, run performance tests, write pseudocode, or ultimately just implement one of your ideas as an experiment
  - perform a team assessment to decide if it‚Äôs a success or failure based on agreed-upon criteria
  - You can always rewrite it later if it turns out to have been the wrong decision.
  - And wouldn't it be great if the other person's idea turns out to be successful?
