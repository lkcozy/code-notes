As you coach someone through a challenge or dilemma, replace problem-solving,
advice-giving, and judgy-sounding questions with authentically curious, truly open questions

| Instead of This                            | **Try** This                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Why did you do that?                       | `What‚Äôs the driving force here?`                                         |
| Why can‚Äôt you move forward?                | W`hat‚Äôs feeling fuzzy about this?`                                       |
| Why did this make you react that way?      | `What feels surprising? `                                                |
| Why does this matter so much to you        | `Which of your core values is being messed with?`                        |
| Why are you stuck?                         | `What‚Äôs feeling stuck?`                                                  |
| Why are you hesitating?                    | `What's the most likely outcome, and what's the worst possible outcome?` |
| How will you measure success?              | `What‚Äôs the #1 most important aspect of this?`                           |
| Who have you talked to about this already? | What do you need?                                                        |
| How can you have better results next time? | `What‚Äôs in the way? `                                                    |
| What‚Äôs your first/next step?               | `What, if anything, is going unsaid? `                                   |
| What‚Äôs your proposed solution?             | What‚Äôs your north star here?                                             |
| What do you want to change about yourself? | What effect/impact do you want to have?                                  |
| Why haven‚Äôt you taken that step yet?       | `What‚Äôs holding you back`                                                |
| How do you know‚Ä¶?                          | What‚Äôs your spidey sense telling you?                                    |
| Why do you want that?                      | `What do you find motivating`?                                           |
| Why not [this other thing/solution]?       | What are you optimizing for                                              |
| Why are you feeling anxious                | `What‚Äôs feeling especially significant about this`?                      |
| Did you already try...?                    | What is your gut telling you?                                            |
| Who can do this for you?                   | If you could wave a magic wand, what one thing would you change?         |
| What if you tried‚Ä¶?                        | What, deep-down, do you truly want?                                      |
