## Tip

When you’re looking to fill an open position, and a former employee applies, it can feel like an easy answer. Hire them, right? They already know the company culture, the nuances of the business nuances, and the people. But defaulting to a "boomerang" employee may be a mistake. To assess the situation carefully and make the right choice, ask yourself these questions.

- `Does the boomerang bring the right skills and capabilities`? Just because they had what it took before they left the company, doesn’t mean they’ll be equipped to meet today’s expectations. Carefully assess whether their current skills and experience match the job description.
- `Do I think this is the easiest option`? You may think the boomerang doesn’t need much onboarding, especially if they’re returning to the same team. But companies, teams, and processes grow and change, and this employee deserves the same amount of ramp time as any new one.
- `Will I be able to retain them long term`? There was a reason they originally left. Have an honest conversation about what they’re looking for, why this role could be fulfilling for them (where the other one wasn’t), and what it will take to keep them engaged.

   <summary>🇨🇳 重新雇用前雇员是正确的决定吗？</summary>

当你想要填补一个空缺的职位，而一位前雇员提出申请，你会觉得这是一个简单的答案。 雇佣他们，对吧？ 他们已经了解了公司文化，业务上的细微差别，以及人。但是，默认招聘前员工可能是一个错误。 仔细地评估情况，做出正确的选择，问自己这些问题。

- 前员工是否带来正确的技能和能力？ 仅仅因为他们在离开公司之前就拥有了这些东西，并不意味着他们就能满足今天的期望。 仔细评估他们目前的技能和经验是否符合职位描述。
- 我认为这是最容易的选择吗？ 你可能认为前员工不需要太多的帮助，尤其是当他们回到同一个团队的时候。 但是，公司、团队和过程都在成长和变化，而且这个员工应该得到与任何新员工相同的时间。
- 我能长期保留吗？ 他们最初离开是有原因的。 诚实地谈一谈他们想要什么，为什么这个角色能让他们满意（而另一个角色却不能），以及怎样才能让他们参与进来。
