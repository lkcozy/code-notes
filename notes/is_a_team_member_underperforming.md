## Tip

What can you do to turn it around? First you have to understand why they aren't meeting your expectations.

There are only 3 reasons why.

- They don't know your `expectations`.
- They don't have the right `skills`.
- They don't have the `motivation`.

If someone doesn't know your expectations, then it's on you.

- Have you been clear about what you expect?
- Have you given them a chance to weigh in on whether the expectations are reasonable?
- Have you explained why the expectations are what they are?

If someone doesn't have the skills to meet your expectations

- Can you acknowledge you hired poorly?
- Can you train them in what their current role needs?
- Can you help them transition to a role that is better fit for their strength?

If someone isn't motivated to meet your expectations

> This one often takes more time to get to the bottom of.

- There are more important things going on in their non-work life
- Your values and theirs diff
- They don't feel their work matters
- The mission doesn't inspire them
- They aren't learning or growing
- They don't feel respected

In some cases, the best thing to do is to recognize there is a mismatch in what the person wants and what you want, and part ways.

In other cases, working on the relationship through better communication can resolve the motivation issue.

I believe everyone has incredible gifts to bring, and life is too short to remain long in an environment that doesn’t see them or isn’t a good fit for turning those gifts into value.

   <summary>🇨🇳 团队成员是否表现不佳 </summary>

你能做些什么来扭转局面？ 首先你必须明白为什么他们没有达到你的期望
只有三个原因。

- 他们不知道你的`期望`。
- 他们没有正确的`技能`.
- 他们没有`动机`。

如果有人不知道你的期望，那就靠你了。

- 你有清楚地表达你的期望吗？
- 你有没有给他们一个机会去权衡这些期望是否合理？
- 你解释过为什么期望是这样的吗？

如果有人不具备满足你期望的技能

- 你能承认你雇佣不当吗？
- 你能否对他们进行培训，使他们了解目前的角色需要什么？
- 你能帮助他们过渡到一个更适合自己的角色吗？

如果有人没有动力满足你的期望, 这通常需要更多的时间才能弄清真相.

- 在他们的非工作生活中发生了更重要的事情
- 你的价值观和他们不同
- 他们觉得工作无关紧要
- 这次任务没有激励他们
- 他们没有学习或成长
- 他们感没有被尊重

在某些情况下，最好的办法是认识到这个人想要的东西和你想要的东西之间存在着不匹配，并且要分道扬镳。

在其他情况下，通过更好的沟通来处理关系可以解决动机问题。

我相信每个人都有不可思议的天赋，生命太短暂了，不能在一个看不到它们或者不适合将这些天赋转化为价值的环境中停留太久。
