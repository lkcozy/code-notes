## Tip

Sometimes you start a new job, and quickly realize it’s not the right role for you. Maybe it’s not what you expected, or the company culture isn’t a good fit after all. If you already hate your new job, what should you do?

Start by reflecting on the source of your disappointment. Make a list of what was promised to you prior to accepting the job and place an asterisk next to those items that aren’t actually happening. Are any of these issues fixable? Resolving any discrepancies that can be rectified should be your first priority.

Then, give the new position some more time. It's normal to feel like a fish out of water on a new team — be patient and focus on developing the relationships that will hopefully make the gig feel like home.

Finally, consider having an open and honest conversation with your manager. You might say something like: “With your permission, I’d like to share some ideas on how to redesign some aspects of my job that will make this role more interesting for me.” Ideally, they’ll follow through on your requests; they should want to make this a job that works for you.

But, after all of this, you might still decide that it’s time to relaunch your job search. That's OK — you deserve to be happy. Go find the job you really want.

   <summary>🇨🇳 不要辞掉你的新工作</summary>

有时你开始了一份新工作，很快就意识到它不适合你。 也许这并不符合你的预期，或者公司的文化根本就不适合你。 如果你已经讨厌你的新工作，你该怎么办？

从回顾你失望的根源开始。 列出一张在接受工作之前承诺给你的事情的清单，并在那些没有发生的事情旁边加上星号。 这些问题有没有可以解决的？ 解决任何可以纠正的不一致应该是你的首要任务。

然后，给新职位更多的时间。 在一个新的团队中，感觉不自在是很正常的——要有耐心，集中精力发展关系，希望能让工作有家的感觉。

最后，考虑一下和你的经理进行一次开诚布公的谈话。 你可以这样说：“在你允许的情况下，我想分享一些关于如何重新设计我的工作的一些方面的想法，使这个角色对我来说更有趣。” 理想的情况是，他们会按照你的要求去做；他们应该想让这份工作适合你。

但是，在所有这些之后，你可能仍然决定是时候重新开始你的求职了。 没关系——你应该快乐。 去找你真正想要的工作。
