- I know the `perception`(opinion) of me is that I can score the basketball well.
- I'm aware that the public `perceives`(see/feel) me as a good basketball scorer.
- I've been asked to do pretty much everything from rebounding to defending to initiating to scoring.
- This is the cherry on the top of the sundae for his coaching career.
- This is sort of a `fitting topping` to his incredible career
- I am excited to rejoin the team in pursuit of a championship.
- The team `brought` the veteran `into the fold`(recruit).
- The lighter your shoes, the faster you can `zip around`(move) the court.
- A `topple`(beat) B, `snapping`(stop/break) two-game `skid`(lose)
- But never led while `trailing`(behind) by as many as 18 points.
- Coach allowed his young roster to play on despite two `sloppy`(careless) passes that led to consecutive steals.
