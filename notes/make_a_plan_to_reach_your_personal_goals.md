## Tip

You probably have things you’d like to get better at, but perhaps, like many people, you struggle to find the discipline. The good news is that you can change your behavior by taking a methodical approach.

Start with `a problem you’d like to solve or a future result you’d like to achieve`, and articulate why it’s important to you. Knowing what your purpose is in taking on this challenge will help you sustain your motivation.

Next, `identify measures of success`. What does achieving your goal look like? How will you know if you’re making progress? Ground yourself with an intention and make a commitment. You might place a sticky note with your intention on your computer where you’ll see it first thing each morning.

Then `choose new behaviors to implement that` will help you achieve your goal, and seek feedback as you practice them. Tell your manager, team members, or a trusted colleague what you’re working on and that you need their input to help you get better.

And don’t forget, as you make progress, to celebrate your successes.

   <summary>🇨🇳 制定实现个人目标的计划</summary>

你可能有一些想要改进的地方，但也许，像许多人一样，你很难找到自律。好消息是，你可以通过采取有条理的方法来改变自己的行为。

从一个你想解决的问题或一个你想实现的未来结果开始，并阐明为什么它对你很重要。知道你接受这个挑战的目的是什么将帮助你保持动力。

接下来，确定衡量成功的标准。实现你的目标是什么样子的?你怎么知道你是否在进步?给自己一个目标并做出承诺。你可以在你的电脑上放一张写着你的意图的便利贴，这样你每天早上第一件事就是看到它。

然后选择可以帮助你实现目标的新行为，并在实践过程中寻求反馈。告诉你的经理、团队成员或值得信任的同事你正在做什么，你需要他们的意见来帮助你变得更好。

当你取得进步的时候，不要忘记庆祝你的成功。
