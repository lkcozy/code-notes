## Tip

When you feel overwhelmed, the way you react can actually make things worse. Here are five common, self-sabotaging mistakes to watch out for — and how to avoid them:

1. `You think you don’t have time for actions that might help you.` Stop waiting for an ideal moment, and do something to help yourself immediately, such as finding a therapist, taking a day off to rest, or calling up a friend.
2. `You don’t use your unconscious mind enough. It’s unreasonable to expect to be focused all the time.` Try taking a walk and letting your mind drift and see what solutions emerge.
3. `You interpret feeling overwhelmed as a weakness`. Being hard on yourself will only lead you to procrastinate or become more perfectionistic. Replace your self-criticism with compassionate self-talk.
4. `You default to your traditional approaches and defenses`. Our strengths may not always work to our advantage; for example, thoughtfulness can become overthinking, or high standards can lead to perfectionism. Be mindful of your instinctive reactions in order to stay flexible in your approach to problem solving.
5. `You withdraw from your support system`. Find ways to connect with people even when you’ve got limited emotional energy.

如果你觉得自己被压垮了，你的反应实际上会让情况更糟。 以下是五种常见的、自毁错误需要注意——以及如何避免它们:

1. `你认为你没有时间去做一些可能会对你有帮助的事情`。不要再等一个完满的时间点了，马上做一些能帮助自己的事情，比如找一个理疗师，休息一天，或者给朋友打电话。
2. `你没有充分利用自己的潜意识`。 期望一直全神贯注是不合理的。试着散散步，让你的思绪自由流动，看看有什么解决办法。
3. `你将一种无所适从的恶感觉的感觉解释为软弱`。自我要求过高只会导致你拖延或者变得更加完美主义。以富有同情心的自言自语代替自我批评。
4. `你预设了你的传统方法和防御系统`。也许我们的优点并不总是有利于我们; 例如，考虑周到可能会变成过度思考，或者高标准可能导致完美主义。 注意你的本能反应，以便在解决问题的方法上保持灵活性。
5. `退出支持系统`。就算你的情绪能量有限，也要想办法与人沟通。
