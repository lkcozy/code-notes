## Tip

Talking about politics at work can be dicey. So what should you do as a manager? While it may be tempting to ban political conversations on your team, doing so can alienate employees and make them feel like they can’t bring their authentic selves to work. Instead, ask yourself: How can I encourage my team to handle differences, respect one another, listen, and learn? Here are a few suggestions.

- `Build empathy for others’ views`. Encourage regular conversation and sharing of personal stories and vulnerabilities on your team. Understanding and respect are built through day-to-day interactions.
- `Invite different perspectives`. Lead by example; admit you don't know everything, and demonstrate open-mindedness.
- `Accept mistakes gracefully`. People tend to avoid political conversations for fear of saying the wrong thing or being misunderstood. Encourage grace and give your team members the benefit of the doubt (unless they've proven they don't deserve it).
- `Demonstrate that disagreement is OK`. Make clear that it’s fine to dissent and debate as long the conversation doesn’t turn into an existential battle where “I’m right” and “You’re wrong.” You don't have to be persuaded by someone's belief in order to understand it and respect it.

   <summary>🇨🇳 你的团队可以尊重地提出不同意见</summary>

在工作中谈论政治是危险的。那么作为一名经理，你应该做些什么呢？虽然在你的团队中禁止政治对话很有诱惑力，但这样做会疏远员工，让他们觉得不能把真实的自己带到工作中去。相反，问问你自己：我怎样才能鼓励我的团队处理分歧，互相尊重，倾听和学习？

- 与他人观点建立共鸣。鼓励您的团队定期进行对话并分享个人故事和弱点。理解和尊重是通过日常互动建立起来的。
- 邀请不同的观点。以身作则，承认自己什么都不懂，表现出开放的心态。
- 优雅地接受错误。人们倾向于避免政治对话，因为害怕说错话或被误解。鼓励宽容，让你的团队成员从怀疑中获益（除非他们已经证明自己不配）。
- 表明不同意是可以的。要清楚地表明，只要谈话没有演变成“我是对的”和“你是错的”这样的生存之战，持不同意见和进行辩论是可以的。你不需要被某人的信仰所说服才能理解它并尊重它。
