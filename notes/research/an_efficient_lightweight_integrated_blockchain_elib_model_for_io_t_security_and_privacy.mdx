## Key Insight

- Proposed an efficient Lightweight integrated Blockchain (ELIB) model to achieve security & privacy in IoT.

Process of storing, observing and monitoring

- BC has the power to resolve the limitations of Internet of Things (IoT) such as data protection and privacy.
- At the same time, BC has `high computation complexity, restricted scalability, high bandwidth overhead and latency` that is unsuitable to IoT.

- Three optimizations are carried out in the presented ELIB model include `lightweight consensus algorithm, certificateless (CC) cryptography and Distributed Throughput Management (DTM) scheme`

- Evaluation with `processing time, energy usage, and overhead`.
