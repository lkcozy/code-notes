## Literature Review 2020-08-28

## Key Insight

- This paper surveyed the use of Blockchain to resolve the myriad of data security concerns in IoT
- The state-of-the-art Blockchain technologies were analyzed in detail, followed by comparison of the technologies in terms of applicability to the IoT scenarios
- The impact of massive IoT devices, limited computing power, low communication bandwidth and error-prone radio links on the performance of Blockchain was studied
- Research directions were pointed out to improve capacity, security and scalability of Blockchains for future effective integration of Blockchain and IoT technologies
- The Blockchain technologies hence suit the IoT applications are identified with potential adaptations and enhancements elaborated on the Blockchain consensus protocols and data structures

## Why it matters

- Traditional security mechanisms alone, such as cryptographic techniques [1], are not enough to preserve data integrity in this enormous scale, seriously restricting the adoption of IoT in the future.
- Inadequate data security and trust of current IoT are seriously limiting its adoption.
- Cloud services cannot ensure data integrity and availability [8], as expected for IoT applications
- Blockchain, a distributed and tamper-resistant ledger, maintains consistent records of data at different locations, and has the potential to address the data security concern in IoT networks.
- While providing data security to the IoT, Blockchain also encounters a number of critical challenges inherent in the IoT, such as a huge number of IoT devices, non- homogeneous network structure, limited computing power, low communication bandwidth, and error-prone radio links.

## Results

Unlike PoW, the attacks with more than 50% hash power in PoA are unable to dominate the existing block chain or determine the chain extension.
If a powerful node holds more than 50% of the network computational contains the heaviest computation quantity as the publicly accepted main chain
