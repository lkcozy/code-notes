Whether it's a novel, a thesis, or a legal brief,
the only way to make progress is to:

- Break your work into small chunks.
- Focus on one at a time.

## Tips

- [Words to avoid in academic writing](https://proofreading.org/blog/words-to-avoid-in-academic-writing/)

| Category                              | Common Examples                                     |

| vague expressions                     | a lot, a couple of, thing, stuff                    |
| exaggerations                         | always/never, definitely, every/none, best/greatest |
| opinionated or subjective expressions | naturally/obviously, of course, should              |
| clichÃ©s                               | at the end of the day, a happy medium               |
| fillers                               | literally, serves to/helps to, really               |
| contractions                          | canâ€™t, wonâ€™t, donâ€™t, isnâ€™t, itâ€™s                    |

- Avoid using marketing terms (e.g., `infinite`) that cannot be unquantifiable.
- Avoid using the `best`, considering rephrase it with `To our best knowledge` or replace it with the `suitable`

## [How to Read a Paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)

[ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³](https://blog.csdn.net/qianlong4526888/article/details/11269129)

This paper describes the 'three-pass' approach and its use in doing a literature survey. The paper

Researchers must-read papers for several reasons: to review them for a conference or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new area. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the paper's highlights after five minutes, the article will probably never be read.

You can choose to (a) set the paper aside, hoping you don't need to understand the material to be successful in your career, (b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or (c) persevere and go on to the third pass
Paper reading skills are put to the test in doing a literature survey

- Assemble collections of resources that focus on the subject matter.
  - Resources can come in the form of research papers, Medium articles, blog posts, videos, GitHub repository etc.
- Conduct a deep dive of any resource you deem relevant to the subject matter.
  - It is crucial that thereâ€™s a method to track the understanding of each shortlisted resources. Andrew Ng, suggests a table of resource plotted against your understanding level that looks similar to the table below.
  - It is advisable to ensure you go through at least 10â€“20% of the content of each paper you have added to the list; this will ensure that you have been exposed to enough of the introductory content within an identified resource and are able to gauge its relevancy accurately.
  - For the more relevant papers/resources identified, it is expected that you progress to a higher level of understanding. Eventually, you will have identified some appropriate resources with content that you understand fully.
  - According to Andrew, an understanding of 5â€“20 papers will showcase a basic understanding within the subject matter, perhaps enough understanding to progress to implementation of techniques.
  - 50â€“100 papers will primarily provide you with a very good understanding of the domain.

* Take structured notes that summarises the key discoveries, findings and techniques within a paper, in your own words.
  - Reading for the purpose of understanding is not done through one pass of the contents within the paper.
  - Be prepared to go through a paper <Highlight>at least three times</Highlight> to have a good understanding of its content
  - In your <Highlight>first pass</Highlight>, start with reading the following sections within the paper: <Highlight>title, abstract and figures</Highlight>.
  - The <Highlight>second pass</Highlight> entails you reading the following sections: <Highlight>introduction, conclusion, another pass through figures and scan through the rest of the content</Highlight>.
  - The <Highlight>third pass</Highlight> of the paper involves reading the <Highlight>whole sections</Highlight> within the paper but skipping any complicated maths or technique formulations that might be alien to you. During this pass, you can also skip any terms and terminologies that you do not understand or arenâ€™t familiar.
  - Those conducting in-depth research into a domain can take a few more passes. These additional passes will mainly be focused on an understanding of the maths, techniques and unknown terminologies presented within the paper.

- Questions To Ask Yourself
  - Describe what the authors of the paper aim to accomplish, or perhaps did achieve.
  - If a new approach/technique/method was introduced in a paper, what are the key elements of the newly proposed approach?
  - What content within the paper is useful to you?
  - What other references do you want to follow?

Head Start is a web-based knowledge mapping software that gives researchers a head start on their literature review (hence the name). It comes with a powerful backend that is is capable of automatically producing knowledge maps from a variety of data, including text, metadata and references. Head Start is implemented based on the D3.js, following Shneiderman's principle of "overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand". The [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) provides the integrated PDF viewer and annotation tool. Several academic search engines are connected through rOpenSci, including [BASE](https://base-search.net/), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [PLOS](https://plos.org/) and [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/).

- [Scholarcy](https://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2018/06/scholarcy-reference-extraction-made.html?view=classic)
