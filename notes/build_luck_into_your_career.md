## Tip

Every success story involves some amount of luck. And contrary to popular belief, serendipity isn't entirely out of our control. Here are two ways to build luck into your career.

First, `actively practice “serendipitous networking" — connecting with others for the sake of getting to know them, their perspectives, and their stories`. Should you find yourself drawn to their story or experience, dig deeper. Ask them questions about how they discovered their passion, what they’ve learned, and what they like or dislike about their role or industry. Their insights might spur a new sense of motivation or a vision that could lead you to your next career move.

Second, `look at big changes in your life through a prism of possibility rather than fear`. Yes, changes that feel out of our control can be scary but try to see them as opportunities. What can you learn? How can you capitalize on the disruption? It can pay off down the road to go with the flow and trust that new opportunities will arise with time.

   <summary>🇨🇳 为你的事业带来好运 </summary>

每一个成功的故事都需要一定的运气。 与流行的信念相反，意外的发现并没有完全超出我们的控制。 这里有两种为你的事业带来好运的方法。

首先，积极实践“偶然的人际关系网”——为了了解他人，了解他们的观点，了解他们的故事。 如果你发现自己被他们的故事或经历所吸引，请深入挖掘。 问他们一些问题，关于他们如何发现自己的激情，他们学到了什么，他们喜欢或不喜欢他们的角色或行业。 他们的洞察力可能会激发出一种新的动力或愿景，引领你迈向下一个职业生涯。

第二 ，从可能性而非恐惧的角度来看待生活中的巨大变化。 是的，感觉不受我们控制的变化可能是可怕的，但试着把它们看作机会。 你能学到什么？ 你怎么能利用这次颠覆呢？ 顺其自然，相信新的机会会随着时间的推移而出现，这是值得的。
