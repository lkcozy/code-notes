## Tip

Imposter syndrome is the persistent, nagging thought that tells us that we’re undeserving of our achievements. If you’ve ever felt that way, you’re not alone. So, how can you channel feelings of self-doubt into something more constructive and productive? Here are some tips.

- **Reframe self-doubt**. Instead of shying away from experiences that trigger your doubt, deliberately embrace them. Remember that `challenges are opportunities to learn`. Think of your nerves as a reminder that there is always room to grow.
- **Be okay not being the smartest person in the room**. Ironically, you appear more confident when you demonstrate the humility and courage to ask about what you don’t know.
- **Cherish feedback, even when it’s critical**. `No one likes to hear what they’re doing wrong, but that’s the only way to grow`. Assume good will from the feedback giver. They took the time to point out your development areas because they want to see you improve and believe that you can. After receiving the feedback, take some time to plan out how you will apply it — you might even do this with the person who gave it to you.

   <summary>🇨🇳 把自我怀疑转化为提升的机会</summary>

冒名顶替者综合征是一种持续不断的、唠叨的想法，它告诉我们，我们配不上所取得的成就。如果你曾经有过这种感觉，你并不孤单。那么，你怎样才能把自我怀疑的感觉转化为更有建设性和更有成效的东西呢? 这里有一些提示。

- 重新审视自我怀疑。与其避免那些让你自我怀疑的经历，不如自觉地拥抱它们。请记住，挑战是学习的机会。把你的神经看成是一个提醒，提醒你总有成长的空间。

- 不是足聪明的人是可以接受的。具有讽刺意味的是，当你表现出谦逊和勇气去问一些你不知道的事情时，你会显得更自信。

- 珍惜反馈，即使它是负面的。没人喜欢听自己做错了什么，但这是成长的唯一途径。假定反馈者是善意的。他们花时间指出你的发展领域，因为他们希望看到你的进步，并相信你可以。收到反馈后，花点时间计划一下你将如何使用它——你甚至可以和那些给予你反馈的人合作
