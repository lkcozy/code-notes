## [Tiny Habits Summary](https://fourminutebooks.com/tiny-habits-summary/)

![](https://fourminutebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tiny-habits-summary-768x384.png)

Tiny Habits shows you the power of applying small changes to your routine to unleash habits' full power to make your life better.

Here are 3 of my favourite principles about making small changes to improve for good:

- Starting embarrassingly small is the secret to keep you going through the boring days and beyond to reach your goals.
- Motivation doesn't work for long-term growth. You need to tap into the potential of behaviour.
- To unlock the power of action, connect your habits with prompts already in your daily routine.
