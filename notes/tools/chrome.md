## Extensions

- [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg)

A lightweight extension to reduce chrome's memory footprint. Perfect if you have a lot of tabs open at the same time. Tabs that have not been viewed after a configurable length of time will be automagically suspended in the background, freeing up the memory and CPU being consumed by that tab.

- [Summary Box!](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender)

Summarize news articles, blog posts, and videos and AI will extract the key sentences

- [DownThemAll](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downthemall/nljkibfhlpcnanjgbnlnbjecgicbjkge)

DownThemAll will help you select, queue, sort and run your downloads faster. It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just OneClick!

- [ClearURLs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk/related)

* [SingleFileZ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/singlefilez/offkdfbbigofcgdokjemgjpdockaafjg)

Save web pages as self-extracting HTML/ZIP hybrid files
