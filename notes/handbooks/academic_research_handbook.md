## Writing

### [Abstract](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/abstract/)

### [Introduction](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/introduction-structure/)

### [Literature Review](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/literature-review/)

### [Methodology](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/methodology/)

### [Results](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/results/)

### [Discussion](https://www.scribbr.com/research-paper/discussion/)

The discussion section is where you delve into the meaning, importance, and relevance of your results.

It should focus on explaining and evaluating what you found, showing how it relate to your literature review, and making an argument in support of your overall conclusion. It should not be a second results section.

Steps to write the section

1. **Summarize your key findings**: a brief recap of your key results
2. **Give your interpretations**: what do your results mean?
3. **Discuss the implications**: why do your results matter?
4. **Acknowledge the limitations**: what can't your results tell us?
5. **Share your recommendations**: avenues for further studies or analyses

What not to include?

1. **Don't introduce new results**: you should only discuss the data that you have already reported in your results section.
2. **Don't make inflated claims**: avoid over-interpretation and speculation that isn't directly supported by your data.
3. **Don't undermine your research**: the discussion of limitations should aim to strengthen your credibility, not emphasize weaknesses of failures.

### [Conclusion](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/write-conclusion/)

The conclusion is the very last part of your thesis or dissertation. The conclusion should be `concise and engaging`. Aim to leave the reader with a clear understanding of the main discovery of argument that your research has advanced.

Steps to write the section:

1. Clearly state the answer to your main research question
2. Summarize the overall argument or key takeaways
3. Reflect any important limitations of the research
4. Show what new knowledge you have contributed
5. Make recommendations for future work on this topic

What not to include?

- Not introduce any new data, interpretations, or arguments
