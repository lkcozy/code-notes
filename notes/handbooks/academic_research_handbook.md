### [How to Read a Paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)

[üá®üá≥](https://blog.csdn.net/qianlong4526888/article/details/11269129)

This paper describes the 'three-pass' approach and its use in doing a literature survey. The paper

Researchers must-read papers for several reasons: to review them for a conference or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new area. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the paper's highlights after five minutes, the article will probably never be read.

You can choose to (a) set the paper aside, hoping you don't need to understand the material to be successful in your career, (b) return to the paper later, perhaps after reading background material or (c) persevere and go on to the third pass
Paper reading skills are put to the test in doing a literature survey

- Assemble collections of resources that focus on the subject matter.
  - Resources can come in the form of research papers, Medium articles, blog posts, videos, GitHub repository etc.
- Conduct a deep dive of any resource you deem relevant to the subject matter.
  - It is crucial that there‚Äôs a method to track the understanding of each shortlisted resources. Andrew Ng, suggests a table of resource plotted against your understanding level that looks similar to the table below.
  - It is advisable to ensure you go through at least 10‚Äì20% of the content of each paper you have added to the list; this will ensure that you have been exposed to enough of the introductory content within an identified resource and are able to gauge its relevancy accurately.
  - For the more relevant papers/resources identified, it is expected that you progress to a higher level of understanding. Eventually, you will have identified some appropriate resources with content that you understand fully.
  - According to Andrew, an understanding of 5‚Äì20 papers will showcase a basic understanding within the subject matter, perhaps enough understanding to progress to implementation of techniques.
  - 50‚Äì100 papers will primarily provide you with a very good understanding of the domain.

* Take structured notes that summarises the key discoveries, findings and techniques within a paper, in your own words.
  - Reading for the purpose of understanding is not done through one pass of the contents within the paper.
  - Be prepared to go through a paper <Highlight>at least three times</Highlight> to have a good understanding of its content
  - In your <Highlight>first pass</Highlight>, start with reading the following sections within the paper: <Highlight>title, abstract and figures</Highlight>.
  - The <Highlight>second pass</Highlight> entails you reading the following sections: <Highlight>introduction, conclusion, another pass through figures and scan through the rest of the content</Highlight>.
  - The <Highlight>third pass</Highlight> of the paper involves reading the <Highlight>whole sections</Highlight> within the paper but skipping any complicated maths or technique formulations that might be alien to you. During this pass, you can also skip any terms and terminologies that you do not understand or aren‚Äôt familiar.
  - Those conducting in-depth research into a domain can take a few more passes. These additional passes will mainly be focused on an understanding of the maths, techniques and unknown terminologies presented within the paper.

- Questions To Ask Yourself
  - Describe what the authors of the paper aim to accomplish, or perhaps did achieve.
  - If a new approach/technique/method was introduced in a paper, what are the key elements of the newly proposed approach?
  - What content within the paper is useful to you?
  - What other references do you want to follow?

| Resources   | 10%-20% | 20%-40% | 40%-60% | 60%-80% | 80%-100% |

## Writing

### [Abstract](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/abstract/)

[Abstract Writing: A Step-by-Step Guide With Tips & Examples](https://typeset.io/resources/abstract-writing-a-step-by-step-guide-with-examples/)

- The purpose of an abstract is to give readers a quick overview of the research paper and help them decide if they want to read the full paper.
- There are different types of abstracts, including descriptive, informative, and structured abstracts.
- A good abstract should be concise, clear, informative, and highlight the key findings of the research.
- The different sections of an ideal abstract include an introduction or background, research methodology, objectives and goals, results, limitations, and conclusion.

### [Introduction](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/introduction-structure/)

[How to Write an Introduction for a Research Paper](https://typeset.io/resources/research-paper-introduction/)

The introduction of your research paper acts as **a road map**, guiding the reader through the **main ideas and arguments**. The purpose of the introduction is to **present your research topic** to the readers and provide a rationale for **why your study is relevant**. It helps the reader **locate your research and its relevance in the broader field** of related scientific explorations.

The introduction should inform the reader about the objectives and scope of your study, giving them an overview of what to expect in the paper.

Key elements

- A hook or **attention-grabbing statement** to capture the reader's interest.
  - a thought-provoking question
  - a surprising statistic
  - a compelling anecdote that relates to your research topic.
- A brief overview of the research topic and its **significance**.
  - highlighting the **gap** in existing knowledge or the problem your research aims to address
- A clear **research question** or **problem statement**.
  - the foundation of your research
  - guides the reader in understanding the unique focus
  - it should be concise, specific, and clearly articulated
- An outline of the paper's structure and main arguments, to help the reader navigate through the paper with ease.

### [Methodology](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/methodology/)

### [Results](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/results/)

### [Discussion](https://www.scribbr.com/research-paper/discussion/)

The discussion section is where you delve into the meaning, importance, and relevance of your results.

It should focus on explaining and evaluating what you found, showing how it relate to your literature review, and making an argument in support of your overall conclusion. It should not be a second results section.

Steps to write the section

1. **Summarize your key findings**: a brief recap of your key results
2. **Give your interpretations**: what do your results mean?
3. **Discuss the implications**: why do your results matter?
4. **Acknowledge the limitations**: what can't your results tell us?
5. **Share your recommendations**: avenues for further studies or analyses

or

- restatement of the research **problem**
- summary of the main **findings**
- **interpretation** of the results
- **comparison** with previous research
- **explanation** of any unexpected findings or discrepancies
- discussion of the **implications** of the results
- identification of **limitations** and **suggestions** for prospective research

What not to include?

1. **Don't introduce new results**: you should only discuss the data that you have already reported in your results section.
2. **Don't make inflated claims**: avoid over-interpretation and speculation that isn't directly supported by your data.
3. **Don't undermine your research**: the discussion of limitations should aim to strengthen your credibility, not emphasize weaknesses of failures.

### [Conclusion](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/write-conclusion/)

The conclusion is the very last part of your thesis or dissertation. The conclusion should be `concise and engaging`. Unlike the discussion section, the conclusion is not the place for a detailed analysis of your results. Instead, it's where you wrap up your argument and leave the reader with a clear understanding of your research and its significance.

Steps to write the section:

1. Clearly state the answer to your main research question
2. Summarize the overall argument or key takeaways
3. Reflect any important limitations of the research
4. Show what new knowledge you have contributed
5. Make recommendations for future work on this topic

or

- restatement of the research **question**
- summary of your main **findings**
- discussion of the **implications** of the research
- **suggestions** for future research

What not to include?

- Not introduce any new data, interpretations, or arguments

### [How To Write A Research Summary](https://typeset.io/resources/how-to-write-research-summary-everything-you-need-to-know/)

- A research summary is a brief, informative snapshot of a complex research paper that comes at the end of the paper and summarizes the topic, methods, and findings.
- An abstract is a description of the topic and context at the beginning of the paper, and the two should not be confused.
- To write a research summary, it is important to thoroughly read and understand the parent paper, identify key elements in each section, write in your own words without plagiarism, double check for word count and grammar, and ask someone to proofread the summary for clarity and comprehension.
