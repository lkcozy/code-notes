ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is essentially an online bot which “interacts in a conversational way,” its creator OpenAI reveals.

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research laboratory based in San Francisco that was founded by Elon Musk and CEO Sam Altman in 2015.

The dialogue format allows ChatGPT to “answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests”.
