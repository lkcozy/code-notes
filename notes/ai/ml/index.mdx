## Resources

### [An Opinionated Guide to ML Research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html)

The authors provided some advice to up-and-coming researchers in machine learning (ML), based on his experience doing research and advising others. The advice covers how to choose problems and organize your time. The keys to success are working on the right problems, making continual progress on them, and achieving continual personal growth. This essay is comprised of three sections, each covering one of these topics.

A roadmap connecting many of the most important concepts in machine learning, how to learn them and what tools to use to perform them.

Namely:

ü§î Machine Learning Problems - what does a machine learning problem look like?
‚ôªÔ∏è Machine Learning Process - once you‚Äôve found a problem, what steps might you take to solve it?
üõ† Machine Learning Tools - what should you use to build your solution?
üßÆ Machine Learning Mathematics - what exactly is happening under the hood of all the machine learning code you're writing?
üìö Machines Learning Resources - okay, this is cool, how can I learn all of this?
