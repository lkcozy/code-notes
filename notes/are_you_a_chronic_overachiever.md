## Tip

It’s good to be ambitious in your career. But a relentless drive to achieve can lead to burnout, hurt your relationships, and create an unhealthy work-life imbalance. How can you dial back your overachieving instincts? Start with these steps:

- `Do some self-reflection`. When did your pattern of overachievement begin? Was it through high performance in school or sports? Be honest with yourself about how your identity and self-worth got hooked on achieving. Those insights will help you begin the process of undoing what is likely decades of programming.
- `Challenge your assumptions`. Ask yourself: What might happen if I were to take my foot off the gas? Am I afraid of failing? Looking incompetent? Letting people down? Our fears are typically based on faulty assumptions and, left unexamined, these assumptions keep us stuck in old patterns.
- `Redefine success`. Take a holistic view. Life isn’t just about professional accomplishments. What else do you want in terms of your health and wellbeing, family, social life, and community? Then choose one small and simple action that will move you toward this broader definition of success.

   <summary>🇨🇳 你是一个长期追求卓越的人吗</summary>

在事业上有抱负是件好事。但是，不懈地追求成就会导致精疲力竭，伤害你的人际关系，并造成一种不健康的工作与生活的不平衡。你怎样才能抑制你过度追求的本能呢?从以下步骤开始:

- 做一些反省。你的卓越模式是什么时候开始的?是通过在学校或运动中的优异表现?诚实地面对自己，你的身份和自我价值是如何被成功所吸引的。这些见解将帮助您开始消除可能需要数十年的编程过程。
- 挑战你的假设。问问你自己:如果我不踩油门会发生什么?我害怕失败吗?看起来无能吗?让人失望?我们的恐惧通常是基于错误的假设，如果不加以检验，这些假设会让我们陷入旧的模式。
- 重新定义成功。采取整体的观点。生活不仅仅是职业成就。在你的健康和幸福、家庭、社交生活和社区方面，你还想要什么?然后选择一个小而简单的行动，让你朝着这个更广泛的成功的定义前进。
