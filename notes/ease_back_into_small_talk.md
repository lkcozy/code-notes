## Tip

Are you nervous about having to make small talk with colleagues when you return to the office? If stopping for an impromptu hallway chat seems a little daunting, you're not alone. Many of us are socially rusty after a long pandemic year. The good news is you can rebuild your small-talk muscle with practice. Here are a few conversation starters. Try them out, tweak them so they feel authentic to you, and use whatever is most helpful.

1. Cooking and baking. Many people discovered their inner chef during the pandemic. You might ask your coworker, “What are your new favorite meals?” or “What’s a simple recipe you discovered recently?”
2. Hobbies. You might be curious about what your colleagues did with their time while not in the office. Try asking, “Did you rediscover any hobbies during quarantine?” or “What was your favorite thing you read/watched/listened to last year?”
3. Vacation plans. With travel restrictions lifting in many parts of the world, lots of us are starting to think about making up for lost vacation time. Ask your work buddies, “What are you looking forward to the most this year?” or “Where’s the first place you’ll travel when you’re able to?”

   <summary>🇨🇳 轻松回到闲聊中 </summary>
当你回到办公室与同事闲聊时，你感到紧张吗？ 如果停下来进行一次即兴的走廊聊天看起来有点吓人，你并不孤单。 在长达一年的大流行之后，我们中的许多人都变得生疏了。 好消息是你可以通过练习重建你的闲聊肌肉。 以下是一些谈话的引子。 试一试，调整它们，让它们让你觉得是真实的，并使用任何最有用的。

1. 烹饪和烘焙。许多人在疫情期间发现了自己内心的厨师。你可能会问你的同事，“你最近最喜欢吃什么?”或“你最近发现的简单食谱是什么?”
2. 业余爱好。你可能会好奇你的同事在不在办公室的时候做了什么。试着问：“你在隔离期间重新发现了什么爱好吗？”或者“你去年最喜欢读/看/听的东西是什么？
3. 假期计划。随着世界许多地方旅行限制的解除，我们很多人开始考虑弥补失去的假期时间。问问你的同事:今年你最期待的是什么?“如果可以的话，第一个去的地方是哪里?”
