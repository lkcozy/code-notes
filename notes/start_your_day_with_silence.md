## Tip

We live in a world full of noise and chatter, and it can be hard to find a break from it all. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, give this mindfulness exercise a shot. It's called the Sphere of Silence, and it’s a 60-minute routine to help you collect your thoughts, stay grounded, and decide how you want to enter your day. There’s one important ground rule: Complete the steps below in silence.

- The first half hour is broken down in three 10-minute segments. Spend the first segment writing your short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals. Then, dedicate the next 10 minutes to assessing your progress on your goals from the previous day. Use the final 10 minutes to take note of unmet goals and assess why you haven’t achieved them. This will motivate you to focus on moving forward.
- Spend the next 10 minutes reading something — an article, a book, maybe even a poem — that teaches you something new or enriches your mind.
- Then, spend 10 minutes writing. Maybe you’ll jot down a reaction to what you just read, or a poem of your own.
- Use the final 10 minutes for self-reflection. This part of the practice allows you to harness your calm during stressful situations and mindfully choose to stay out of negativity.

   <summary>🇨🇳 用沉默开始你的一天 </summary>

我们生活在一个充满噪音和喋喋不休的世界，很难从中找到一个休息的时间。如果你感到不知所措，就试试这个练习吧。它被称为“沉默的范围”，它是一个 60 分钟的例行程序，可以帮助你集中思想、保持冷静，并决定你想要如何进入你的一天。有一个重要的基本原则:安静地完成下面的步骤。

- 前半个小时分为三个 10 分钟的片段。在第一部分写下你的短期、中期和长期目标。然后，用接下来的 10 分钟来评估你在前一天的目标上取得的进展。用最后的 10 分钟记录下你没有完成的目标，并评估为什么你没有完成它们。这将激励你专注于前进。
- 花 10 分钟读一些东西——一篇文章，一本书，甚至一首诗，可以教会你新的东西或丰富你的思想。
- 然后，花 10 分钟写作。也许你会写下对你刚刚读到的东西的反应，或者你自己的一首诗。
- 利用最后 10 分钟进行自我反省。这部分练习可以让你在压力的情况下保持冷静，谨慎地选择远离消极情绪。
