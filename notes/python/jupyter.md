Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web application that interfaces with the iPython repl, allowing you to run structured but iterative Python scripts. It is the de facto choice for data scientists to rapidly prototype pipelines, visualise data, or perform ad hoc analysis.

Jupyter notebooks are a fantastic way to visual any data sets you might have, as well and conduct ad hoc analysis. It is especially useful for querying databases and displaying the data in a repeatable manner.

This article dives into Jupyter Interactive Widgets and the ipyleaflet package, an interactive maps visualization system for Jupyter. Jupyter Interactive Widgets are ‚Äúspecial objects‚Äù that can be instantiated by the user in their code and result in a counterpart component being created in the front-end.

ipyleaflet is a Jupyter - LeafletJS bridge, bringing mapping capabilities to the notebook and JupyterLab. Built as a bridge between the LeafletJS package and Jupyter, the ipyleaflet API maps to that of LeafletJS, bringing most of the core features of the package to Jupyter, and enabling a few popular LeafletJS extensions. A small difference is that following the Python coding style, ipyleaflet makes use of snake_case instead of CamelCase for attribute names.

### Libraries

- [Voil√†](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila)

Voil√† turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications.

Unlike the usual HTML-converted notebooks, each user connecting to the Voil√† tornado application gets a dedicated Jupyter kernel which can execute the callbacks to changes in Jupyter interactive widgets.
