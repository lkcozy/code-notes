- Should love to learn new technologies. As tech grows up fast. So it is essential to keep up to date and to stay close to new trends.
- Should open to new ideas, embrace the changes and enjoy challenges. As we are a standup and we are trying to solve the new problem most of the time, be ready for it. Especially for frontend, it is messier than back-end because every user behaves differently.
- Could think a problem in a bigger picture and could also break the goal down into manageable steps. So it is quicker to get started but also have the code flexible and scalable.
- Love coding and is a self-motivated and self-disciplined person who could fill the blank ticket himself and take pride in the work.
- Should be peaceful about some of process, as in the company, we have code review culture. Make sure the code have a good test coverage in the first place and don't mind to have the code tested by PR reviewer and do not take it personally.
- Should be a good team player who enjoy to work together with others. not only the developers, but could also build strong relationships with product, design etc. Communicate if there is any problem
